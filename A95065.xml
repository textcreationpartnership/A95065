            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>WHat the Sun is to the world, that the Scripture is to the Church. No man can ſee the Sun it ſelfe, nor any thing in the world, but by the light of the Sun. No man can know God, nor any of his creatures, aright, but by the Scripture. The</hi> Rabbins <hi>tell us,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. There is no glory but the Law. Aboth. cap. 4. <hi>And</hi> Rab. Chija <hi>in the</hi> Jeruſalem Talmud <hi>in</hi> Peah, <hi>tells us, that in his account,</hi>

               <pb facs="tcp:118645:3"/>All the world wholly is not of equall value with one word out of the Law. <hi>The labour then of thoſe men of God, whom God hath fitted for interpretation of Scripture, is not lightly to be esteemed. The rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the difficulty and profitableneſſe of the work. The difficulty</hi> Auguſtin <hi>ſets out well,</hi> Lib. 11. ſuper Gen. ad literam. Major eſt hujus Scripturae autoritas, quàm omnis humani ingenii perſpicacitas. Greater is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uthority of this Scripture, then the perſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of all humane wit. <hi>The profit of it is as well ſet out by</hi> Hierom. ad Eph. lib. 1. Non putemus in verbis Scripturarum eſſe Evangelium, ſed in ſenſu; non in ſuperficie, ſed in medulla; non in ſermonum foliis, ſed in radice rationis: Let us not think the Goſpel is in the words of the Scriptures, but in the ſenſe; not in the outſide, but in the marrow; not in the leaves of words, but in the root of reaſon. <hi>Among many other Books of the Scripture, this of the</hi> Proverbs <hi>excels in height of matter and expreſſions. It needs therefore a carefull Interpreter. The method uſed by me is new, and never formerly exactly followed in every Verſe, by any Writer, Protestant or Papiſt, that ever I read.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Ye have the Grammatical ſenſe in the various ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of every</hi> Hebrew <hi>word throughout the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which gives light to many other texts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Ye have the Rhetoricall ſenſe, in the Tropes and Figures.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>If it be objected, that there are many Comments already on other Books of Scripture, and on this in particular; I confeſſe it is a truth. I my ſelf have made uſe of forty Writers on this Book of the</hi> Proverbs, <hi>as will
<pb facs="tcp:118645:3"/>appear by the Catalogue of Authors added. Yet every one ſees not ſo many, nor cannot underſtand them all; nor have means to buy them, or time to read them. Will it hurt any man to have the marrow of them all in one Book? Will it not ſave him much time, money, labour? Beſides, the Reader will find ſomething new, that is not in any of them. Gods hand is not ſhortened. He can as well manifeſt his truth by us, as by former Writers. And the rather, becauſe we have their help. A dwarf ſtanding on a gaints ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, may ſee further then the giant. I have made choyce of you (Worthy Gentlemen) for Patrons of this Work, not doubting, but if any ſhall oppoſe the truth manifeſted in it, ye will ſtand up with me for the defence of it. A more particular engagement to prefix your honorable names, is that great truſt the State hath put in you, to take care of the maintenance of many godly Miniſters, upon whom ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſand ſouls depend in this Nation. I have found you faithfull and carefull. So have many other godly Miniſters. The great God that hath laid great a charge upon you, make you still faithfull diſchargers, that ſo your names may be honorable to poſterity, and your ſouls ſaved eternally. So I ſhall never ceaſe to pray, and ever remain</hi>

            <opener>
               <salute>Chriſtian and courteous Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BE pleaſed to obſerve a few things, which may help thee much in the peruſing of this Book.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Be not offended that the places cited in it are not ſet down at large, but onely ſome part of the Verſes quoted. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Reader may hereby perceive in what words the ſtrength of the proof lies; to wit, in thoſe words he findes here. This I learned of the <hi>Jewiſh Rabbins,</hi> who uſe not to tranſcribe the whole Verſe cited, but onely thoſe words wherein the ſtrength of the proof is. Indeed the <hi>Maſorites</hi> do otherwiſe. They ſet down only the beginning of the ſentence, and leave the Reader to ſeck for the word in the text quoted. But this breeds trouble and confuſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Writing thus conciſely, will make men minde the better what they read.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It will make them look into their Bibles for further ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It makes this Book the ſhorter, and ſo the cheaper.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Complain not that many things are taken out of other Writers and Commenters. For,</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:118645:4"/>
            <p n="1">1. Here is no wrong to them. God gave thoſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to them, they to us, and why may not we give them to others?</p>
            <p n="2">2. No wrong to thee who hath the pith and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of forty Tranſlations and Comments in this Book. It would have coſt thee (as it hath done me) much more money to buy them, much more time and labour to read them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thou wilt finde many things added, that God hath given in to me, that are not in any of them; for all mine and theirs is from him alone, and to him is due all the glory.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Object not to me, that for the various ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> words, I borrow much out of the laſt Edition of the <hi>Annotations</hi> on the Bible, out of the Notes upon <hi>Job.</hi> For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It cannot be called borrowing, for a man to take his owne, and none of my partners in that great Work went that way but my ſelfe. And having taken much pains there, why ſhould I take more about the ſame words?</p>
            <p n="2">2. There I give onely figures for <hi>chap.</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> So that if the figures be falſe printed (as they are too often) the Reader is to ſeek for the place. Here I ſet down the words alſo, that he cannot miſtake.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The figures are here alſo corrected by me in all I make uſe of from thence.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Some ſignifications are added in ſome words.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Some are left out that were miſtaken.</p>
            <p n="6">6. All have not money to buy, nor time to read thoſe large <hi>Annotations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. Where thou findeſt other texts in this Book quoted for words, or proofs of doctrines, there look for the like matter. For,</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:118645:5"/>
            <p n="1">1. No man handles one point fully in one place.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God may give a man new matter the ſecond time, not thought of before.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I did of purpoſe never look back to thoſe former places, though they lay by me, hoping that God that put me upon it again, would give me ſome other thoughts of it.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Quarrel not that ſome places are twice quoted, and ſome things repeated in the Book. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. I may forget what I did before in ſo large a task.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All Readers will not read all the Book. So ſome may finde them in one place, ſome in another.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, whereas by reaſon of my far diſtance from tke preſſe, many faults have eſcaped, and I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore added a Table of the moſt materiall ones that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the ſenſe, I deſire that the Reader would follow the practiſe of a godly and reverend Miniſter in <hi>Kent,</hi> who reads no Book till he have firſt corrected all the faults in it with his pen, according to the Authors minde ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the <hi>Errata.</hi> So ſhalt thou meet with no ſuch rubs in the way, nor puzzle thine owne head to finde another mans meaning. This is all: and ſo commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding both thee and the Book to Gods ſpeciall bleſſing, and deſiring if thou get any good by it, thou wouldſt give God the glory, and me thy prayers; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the cuſtome of Preachers, and writers to ſay ſomething by way of Preface, when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin a book. The Text it ſelf gives occaſion to ſpeak of the worth of the work, and of the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But I ſhall by way of Preface ſpeak firſt of all <hi>Solomon</hi>'s works comparing one with another. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of this particular work. Three works there are of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> in Scripture, arguments of that large wiſdome, which God gave him reſembling his people: the one like the ſand on the ſea ſhore, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4.29. the other like the duſt of the earth, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1.9. That he begged, that he had. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1.10, 11, 12. <hi>Give me now wiſdome and knowledge, that I may goe out and come in before this people. For who can judge this thy people,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118645:6"/>that is ſo great? And God ſaid to</hi> Solomon, <hi>Becauſe this was in thine heart, and thou haſt not asked riches, wealth or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet haſt asked long life, but haſt asked wiſdome and knowledge for thy ſelf, that thou maiſt judge my people, ever whom I have made thee King: wiſdome and knowledge is granted unto thee, and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honour, ſuch as none of the Kings have had, that have been before thee, neither ſhall there any after thee have the like.</hi> The <hi>Proverbs</hi> ſet out true Wiſdome; <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> worldly Vanity; <hi>Canticles,</hi> heavenly Love. The firſt teacheth us how to live in the world. The ſecond, how to wean us from the world. The third, how to rejoyce in the love of Chriſt. And <hi>Solomon</hi> varies the title ſutably to the occaſion. In the beginning of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> he writes himſelf King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that he might teach all his people. In <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> he cals himſelf King in <hi>Jeruſalem, Eccl.</hi> 1.1. that the people that had ſeen his vanity there, might not imitate it. In the <hi>Canticles</hi> he takes no kingly title at all, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.1. No more, but bare <hi>Solomon. Proprium nomen ſufficit, neſcit ſe eſſe regem. He is content with his own name, taking no notice that he was a King.</hi> He had no title to Chriſts love as a King. Every good ſubject of his had as much title to it as he. For this work of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> I ſhall treat of ſeven generall heads.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of the number of <hi>Solomons</hi> Proverbs. 2. Of the time of uttering them. 3. Of the ſpeakers of theſe Proverbs. 4. Of compoſing them. 5. Of the manner of ſpeech in them. 6. Of the diviſion of the book. 7. Of my manner of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, The number of <hi>Solomons</hi> Proverbs. They are ſaid to be three thouſand, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4.32.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> What is become of all the reſt, for we have not one thouſand of them left?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Either they were not written by himſelf or others, for it is not ſaid he writ them, but he ſpake them: or elſe they were loſt in proceſſe of time being not ſo much regarded as the reſt, as not appointed by God for canonicall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to abide for the information of his people to the end of the world. So all his Songs being one thouſand and five, are loſt, except the Canticles the beſt of them: and all his Philoſophicall diſcourſes of the nature of all kinde of bodily creatures, mentioned 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4.32, 33.</p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:118645:6"/>
                  <p>For the ſecond thing, The time of uttering them. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that <hi>Solomon</hi> did ordinarily utter them at his table, and eſpecially at feaſts for the good of ſuch as did eat with him, or attended on him. It was the cuſtome of the Philoſophers, and other wiſe men among the Heathen to ſpeak of profitable things at their meals, eſpecially at ſupper, for they ſeldome had ſet dinners. And the Jewes feaſts were ordinarily at ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, when the buſineſſe of the day was over, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.16. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.9, 17. Hence it was ſaid, that they who ſupt with <hi>Plato,</hi> were better the next day, both for their temperate fare and good diſcourſes. Of this practiſe writ <hi>Atheneus, Plutarch, Gellius, Macrobius,</hi> and others. <hi>Inſita natura ſcientiae cupiditas efficit, ut etiam inter epulas aliquid aut docerent aut diſcerent libenter, aut didiciſs: ſe oſtenderent,</hi> Athen. l. 1. <hi>The deſire of knowledge bred in men by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cauſed them even in their feaſts, either to teach or learn ſomething willingly, or to ſhew that they had learned. Indocti ex ea conſuetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine eruditionis aliquid accipiunt, &amp; ſicut mutae literae ex commixtione vocalium in valde concinna, &amp; dearticulata crumpunt verba: ita ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des iſti ex convictu ſapientum ſapere incipiunt.</hi> Plutarch in lib. Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſiac. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlearned men out of that cuſtome get ſome erudition, and as conſonants mixed with vowels break forth into very fit, and articulate words, ſo theſe rude ones begin to be wiſe by feeding with wiſe men.</hi> And <hi>Homer</hi> the wiſeſt of their Poets, when he would bring in the Heathen Gods diſcourſing about any weighty matter, brings them in ſpeaking at a feaſt, <hi>Athen. l.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>And this cuſtome of the Heathen in Philoſophy was imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Gods people in Divinity. As may appear by divers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions in this Book. So <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaking of a feaſt, ſaith, <hi>The morſell which thou haſt eaten thou ſhalt vomit up, and loſe thy ſweet words,</hi> Prov. 23.8. &amp; 25.11. <hi>A word fitly ſpoken is like apples <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> gold in pictures of ſilver.</hi> As in the end of feaſts they brought i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> yellow apples in wrought ſilver diſhes (for ſo the word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies) to conclude the feaſt, which began with egges, and ended with apples <hi>(ab ovo ad mala)</hi> ſo when their bellies were full, then they began to feed their ſouls with ſome ſpirituall food. So ſome read that in <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.2. <hi>I will bring thee into my mothers houſe, there thou ſhalt inſtruct me, I will cauſe thee to drink of ſpiced wine, of the juice of my pomegranats. Solomons</hi> houſhold proviſion plentifull, and daily is ſet down, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4.7, &amp;c. And his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118645:7"/>annexed to that diſcourſe, verſ. 29, &amp;c. ſhewed in ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Proverbs, very likely at his table. The Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> obſerves the order of his table, and bleſſes his ſervants, that attended, not for their delicate fare, but for hearing <hi>Solomons</hi> wiſe ſentences there dropt out, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 10.5, 8. To this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome <hi>Solomon</hi> alludes (or rather <hi>David,</hi> as we ſhall hear hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) when he brings in Wiſdome making a feaſt, and giving good counſell withall, chap. 9.1, &amp;c. Men are willing to learn of good houſe-keepers, that invite them, and of ſuch as are familiar and uſe to eat and drink with them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt the true <hi>Solomon</hi> fed the people miraculouſly, that they might the more willingly hearken to his Doctrine. And he taught often at the table, and largely at his laſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. A thing much neglected now adaies, but very profitable, if men would intermingle pious diſcourſes with their meat, and ſo feed ſouls and bodies together, themſelves and others at the ſame table.</p>
                  <p>For the third thing, The ſpeakers of theſe Proverbs. Some conceive them to be all ſpoken by <hi>Solomon,</hi> but they are deceived. The contrary appears evidently. For after that <hi>Solomon</hi> had delivered his own thoughts in the three firſt Chapters, at the 4. verſe of the 4 Chapter he brings in his father <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking. At the beginning of the 10 Chapter, he ſpeaks again himſelf. In the 30 Chapter <hi>Agurs</hi> Propheſie is inſerted and his mother <hi>Bathſheba's</hi> inſtruction in the laſt Chapter. And ſome think that the firſt ſix verſes of this chapter were written by ſuch as put the Proverbs together, as a Preface to the reſt, as ſome conceive the firſt Pſalme to be made by <hi>Ezra,</hi> who (as they imagine) put the Pſalmes in order. It being more fit in their underſtanding, for another man to commend the work, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>en for <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf. As it is certain, the end of <hi>Deute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronomy</hi> was not written by <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor the ſecond of <hi>Samuel</hi> by <hi>Samuel,</hi> being written after his death, as the other was after the death of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Yet theſe may be <hi>Solomons</hi> words in the firſt ſix verſes of this Chapter for all that objection, and the ſtyle ſeems to ſpeak as much. He might commend the work, not out of oftentation, but out of deſire to draw others to read it for their ſpirituall good. So <hi>Jeremy</hi> commends his Propheſie by his pedegree, and by thoſe famous Kings under
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118645:7"/>whom he propheſied. <hi>The words of</hi> Jeremiah <hi>the ſon of</hi> Hilkiah <hi>of the Prieſts that were in</hi> Anathoth <hi>in the land of</hi> Benjamin, <hi>to whom the Word of the Lord came in the daies of</hi> Joſiah <hi>the ſon of</hi> Amon <hi>King of</hi> Judah <hi>in the thirteenth year of his reign, &amp;c.</hi> In <hi>Job</hi> there are many ſpeeches of others, and in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> is <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiahs</hi> Song, yet the books bear the name of <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> So we call the Pſalmes <hi>Davids,</hi> yet many of them were made by others, but the moſt by him. So may theſe be called <hi>Solomons</hi> Proverbs, becauſe the moſt are his, and the reſt collected out of his writings though firſt ſpoken by others. Neither is there any neceſſity that thoſe ſix verſes ſhould be written after <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> death, as the end of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> and ſecond of <hi>Samuel</hi> were after <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Samuels</hi> death.</p>
                  <p>For the fourth point, of compoſing them together. Some think they were all written together by <hi>Solomons</hi> own hand, and ſo delivered by him at firſt in one entire piece, as now they are; and that <hi>Agur</hi> and <hi>Lemuel</hi> were names of <hi>Solomon,</hi> or elſe imaginary perſons brought in conferring with <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> as the Heathen had ſuch in their written Books of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes at feaſts. But that cannot be, for <hi>Agurs</hi> name alone is not ſet down, but his parentage alſo, which is a note of a true ſtory, and that that Chapter is his. <hi>Lemuel</hi> indeed is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf by all or moſt Commenters, but the words are his mothers inſtructions. <hi>Salazar</hi> to maintain this opinion is forced to ſay, that the two laſt Chapters were written before chap. 25. that it might have ſome face of a conference: others think, that though moſt of theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs were uttered by <hi>Solomon,</hi> and left in ſcattered papers, yet they were put together by others. <hi>Quinchi</hi> thinks by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> Others by <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> men. But the likelieſt is, that <hi>Solomon</hi> left all the twenty four firſt Chapters written in that order that now they are. And that learned men appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> writ the laſt out of <hi>Solomons</hi> remaining papers, and among the reſt <hi>Agurs</hi> Propheſie, and <hi>Lemuels</hi> Mothers inſtructions. And that becauſe in the beginning of the 25. Chapter the Holy Ghoſt makes a tranſition from what was written before, (very likely, entirely by the Author) and what was copied out after by <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> men. The ſame thing learned men conceive of <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalmes, that the 72
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118645:8"/>firſt were left by <hi>David</hi> himſelf in that order they now ſtand, becauſe of the concluſion of the 72 Pſalme, <hi>The prayers of</hi> David <hi>the ſon of</hi> Jeſſe <hi>are ended.</hi> And that the reſt after, though many of them be of <hi>Davids</hi> penning, yet were ſet in that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by <hi>Ezra,</hi> or ſome other.</p>
                  <p>For the fifth thing, The manner of ſpeech uſed in them. Sometime <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks in his own words, ſometime in his father <hi>Davids,</hi> as chap. 4.4, &amp;c. and ſometime in <hi>Agurs,</hi> as chap. 30. and ſometime in his Mothers, as chap. 31. that ſo he might affect men the more with this variety, and ſhew whence he had his firſt knowledge, and what pains both his parents took with him. A fit Precedent for other parents.</p>
                  <p>For the ſixth head, The diviſion of the Book. There is in it, 1 <hi>Solomons</hi> Preface to his Proverbs in the three firſt chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. 2 <hi>Davids</hi> Catechiſme for his ſon <hi>Solomon,</hi> with a ſhort Preface of <hi>Solomons</hi> to it, from the beginning of the fourth chapter to the end of the ninth. 3 <hi>Solomons</hi> own Proverbs not only uttered, but written by himſelf, as appears by the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the tenth chapter, which reach to the end of chap. 24. 4 Such Proverbs of <hi>Solomon</hi> as were collected by <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> men long after <hi>Solomons</hi> death, from thence to the end of chap. 29. 5 <hi>Agurs</hi> Propheſie, chap. 30. 6 <hi>Solomons</hi> Mothers inſtructions, chap. 31. In the Preface and <hi>Davids</hi> Catechiſme, the coherence may give light ſometimes, where the ſentences hang well toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But in the other parts the oppoſition in each verſe, gives moſt light in many places, for there is ſeldome any coherence of verſes one with another, but diſtinct Proverbs uttered at divers times, and upon divers occaſions.</p>
                  <p>For the ſeventh and laſt thing propounded, My method in handling them ſhall be,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To give you the Grammaticall ſenſe, or tranſlation, and originall force, and various ſignifications of the words.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Rhetorical ſenſe, or interpretation, ſhewing what is literally and what figuratively ſpoken.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Logicall ſenſe holding out the coherence of one verſe or word with another, and the ſtrength of arguments couched in the words.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Theologicall ſenſe in ſome ſhort obſervations out of the words, not without ſutable applications. I ſhall ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118645:8"/>parallel theſe Proverbs with other like Scriptures, and ſometimes with ſentences of other authors, and rob the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to enrich the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> I begin with the firſt part, and am retiring to my text, as faſt as I can. It is part of <hi>Solomons</hi> Preface contained in the three firſt chapters, for as for the ſix next from chap. 4. to chap. 10. they are <hi>Davids</hi> words. For <hi>Solomon</hi> fathers them upon him, chap. 4.4. and diſchargeth him not till chap. 10.1. and then challengeth the reſt follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or many chapters to himſelf, and ſets his ſtamp upon them afreſh. <hi>The Proverbs of</hi> Solomon. Which had been needleſſe, if <hi>Solomon</hi> had ſpoken before, ſince he brought in <hi>David</hi> ſpaking. He ſets out his Fathers goodneſſe in teaching him ſo abundantly, and his own in learning ſo plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
                  <p>To return to <hi>Solomons</hi> words, note, 1. The inſcription of the Book to the 7 verſe of this chapter. 2. His counſell to his ſon to the end of the 3 chapter. In the inſcription note 1. The penman, verſ. 1. 2. The profit and ſcope of the book in the five verſes following.</p>
                  <p>I am now arrived at the haven, and come to my Text. And firſt for the Grammaticall ſenſe or tranſlation of the words.</p>

I beſeech you bear with prolixity in Expoſition. It may be with me, as I finde it with moſt Commenters, who are like Horſes, free at the beginning, and out of breath, before they end. And if you bear with me, I will bear with you then, and God will bear with us all. The ſame words will come again and again, which I ſhall refer to the former places to avoid Tautologies, and that will be the mother of brevity. I come now to the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ological ſenſe or obſervations. The 1. Doctrine ſhall be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. 1. This book of the <hi>Proverbes</hi> is of excellent uſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe it conſiſts of Proverbs, ruling ſentences, full of wiſdome and gravity, more excellent then other ſentences, and more currant among men, looked upon as Princes on earth, or as the two great lights, the Sun and Moon among the Stars in heaven. More excellent then other Proverbs, which are meerly humane, whereas theſe are of divine authority, as being
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118645:11"/>parts of Canonical Scripture. <hi>Solomon</hi> was wiſe, but a greater then <hi>Solomon</hi> is here. Gods Spirit directed him. More ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent then many other parts of Scripture, for not the pith only, but the husk alſo is excellent. Senſe, and expreſſion are both admirable. High matter and ſtyle. <hi>I will ſpeak of excellent things.</hi> Heb. <hi>Princely,</hi> or <hi>leading things,</hi> chap. 8.6. And alſo becauſe they are all Proverbs. So are not ordinary writings, nor other books of Scripture. This book containeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but illuſtrious ſentences. They need not be marked with a ſtar, or finger, or <hi>N. B. Nota bene, Mark well,</hi> in the margin, as in other books: and as <hi>Seneca</hi> was fain to ſet marks in books, on things he liked, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 6. for all here are remarkable. And after the nine firſt chapters ye need not ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for light by reading many verſes together to finde the ſenſe of one: but each contains its own light within it ſelf, like a Lanthorn. They are like an heap of Corn, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are many grains, but no one mixed with another, each hath its weight in it ſelf. They are brief ſentences fit for learners, for mans memory is ſhort, forgetful, and confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with prolixity. They make the deeper impreſſion for their brevity. They contain matters of piety, morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, civility, houſhold affairs, and are uſefull for all men. They contain alſo many parables, and ſimilitudes, which are very fit to teach, (Chriſt taught often by them) to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade and delight. Take away metaphors out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ye take away a great part of the choyceſt houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ſtuffe out of the houſe. God therein playes with us infants, and as it were ſtutters to us, and cures our eyes with clay. He ſets out things, that men are deſirous to underſtand, and are too high for them, by things more obvious, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful. If this will not work with men, nothing will. So much Chriſt himſelf teſtifies, <hi>If I have told you earthly things, and ye beleeve not: how ſhall ye beleeve, if I tell you of heavenly things?

Who can deny, that ſome very ſhort precepts strike effectually upon the most ignorant?

Pictures are very delightful to us, and affect more then letters. We hang them therefore in our ſight. Sight of ſhadows works often more then words of ſubſtance.

                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe they are <hi>Solomons Proverbs,</hi> to whom God gave more wiſdome then to any other meer man ſince the fall, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving either in his time, before, or after it. <hi>For he was wiſer then all men; then</hi> Ethan <hi>the</hi> Ezrahite, <hi>and</hi> Heman, <hi>and</hi> Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>col, <hi>and</hi> Darda <hi>the ſons of</hi> Mahol, <hi>and his fame was in all Nations round about,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4.31. When God gives more excellent giſts to ſome then to others, he conveys more excellent things to us by them, then by others. Greater talents are put to greater uſe. <hi>Paul</hi> laboured more then all the Apoſtles in preaching and writing, and ſpreading the Word far and neer. <hi>I laboured more aboundantly then they all,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. <hi>From</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>and round about to</hi> Illyricum, <hi>I have fully preached the Goſpel of Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 15.19. For God had beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed better breeding, and greater gifts on him then on others. <hi>I was brought up</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in this City at the feet of</hi> Gamaliel, <hi>and taught according to the perfect manner of the Law of the Fathers, Act.</hi> 22.3. <hi>He was caught up into Paradiſe, and heard unſpeakable words, which it is not lawfull for a man to utter,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4. He writ more highly, then the other writers of the Epiſtles, (as <hi>John</hi> the beloved Apoſtle excelled among the Goſpel writers) to ſhew what learning could doe improved by grace, though now too much contemned. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> wiſhed for three things, To have ſeen Chriſt in the fleſh, <hi>Paul</hi> in the Pulpit, and <hi>Rome</hi> in her glory. So doubtleſſe more excellent things are commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to and by <hi>Solomon,</hi> then ſome other holy writers; for pipes filled with water, or Wine, run out according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>Solomon</hi> was alſo the ſon of <hi>David.</hi> His Father was a powerful King, a wiſe Prophet, and an holy man, who bred his ſon accordingly. Had he been meanly bred, as Amos <hi>among the herdmen of</hi> Tekoa, <hi>Amos</hi> 1.1.7.14, 15. yet being ſo wiſe he had deſerved audience, much more coming of ſuch a Father. He was alſo a King, not a ſubject, nor a Tyrant, but a wiſe, and a good King. Kings ſpeeches though mean are Chronicled, and greedily received, as from thoſe that in regard of their Office have Gods Image ſtampt upon them, and are called <hi>Gods, Pſal.</hi> 82.5, 6. In that reſpect they are worthy of audience. Neither was he King of a ſmall Nation, but of <hi>Iſrael</hi> a great people, which he guided with much wiſdome, and made very proſperous, and therefore may well guide us
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118645:12"/>by his counſels. He was King of all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> of all the twelve Tribes, before the Kingdome was leſſened by diviſion, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. It was much more populous in his time, then in after dayes. He was alſo King of Gods people, and of his only people upon earth, <hi>a great, wiſe, and underſtanding Nation, Deut.</hi> 4.6. and beſt able to judge of theſe Proverbs of all the people in the world. Having Gods Law to guide them, they could beſt diſcern the ſolidity of <hi>Solomons Proverbs.</hi> And fit it was that they ſhould have a very wiſe King. Therefore we may the better learn of him. As this addes to <hi>Solomons</hi> honour to be King over the wiſeſt people in the world, ſo to our eſteem of the Book written by the wiſeſt man, a great King, and ſon of a great King, and King of the wiſeſt people.</p>
                  <p>The firſt uſe is for Miniſters to ſtudy theſe Proverbs well, that they may be able to crack the ſhell, and give the kernel to the people. So great is the fulneſſe of theſe ſentences, that though many have written, and preached on this book al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, yet they have left matter enough for others. As in the ſilver and other rich mines men are dayly digging, and yet ſtill meet ſucceſſively with more matter of like price, that which the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> alludes unto, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.39. So the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of divine wiſdome in this Book cannot be drawn dry. Study it well, that ye may not wrong the writer, as one wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, that if <hi>Job</hi> were now alive, he would be more weary of his Comment then he was of all his troubles; and ſo he left writing, as deſpairing of ever finding out <hi>Jobs</hi> true meaning. He that will profit by theſe Proverbs, muſt bring the words to the ſpeakers intention, and not force them to ſerve his own. You muſt not make a Sermon firſt, and then chuſe a Text here: but firſt chuſe a Text, and then ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther points naturally out of it, the words being well cleared firſt, becauſe oft they are more obſcure then in ſome other books.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond uſe is for the people, that they ſhould read this book often, and hear it expounded willingly. Many deſpiſe Books, becauſe written by mean men. This is by a famous King. King <hi>James</hi> his <hi>Baſilicon Doron</hi> took much for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors ſake. Here the Sun ſtands ſtill for your inſtruction, as he did in <hi>Gibeon.</hi> Woe to them, who hear not <hi>Solomon</hi> Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:118645:13"/>within their gates, when the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> went ſo far to her great coſt to hear him. And woe to thoſe great Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians, that leave <hi>Solomon</hi> to follow <hi>Matchiavil.</hi> How great a favour is it to confer daily with ſo great a King? How great a fin is it to leave him to confer with humane works, as if a young man ſhould leave a choiſe Lady to wooe a naſty begger woman? Here is a golden, there a leaden pen. If <hi>Solomons</hi> Crown, or Sword, or Scepter were to be ſeen, how would people flock after it? His Books are his beſt reliques. No danger of ſuperſtition in converſing with theſe. Here is <hi>Solomons</hi> Crown, and Jewels, and treaſure. Attend then to the reading of them, or hearing of them expounded to the ends mentioned in the five verſes following, and if thou attain to them, thou wilt not loſe thy labour.</p>
                  <p>For particular obſervations. <hi>The Proverbs.</hi> 2. <hi>Doct.</hi> All Scripture ſhould be read with diligence, but ſome places more carefully, then other.

Hence <hi>Iſaac</hi> had his name from laughter, <hi>Jacob</hi> from ſupplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Noah</hi> from reſt; <hi>Zedekiah</hi> the King, and <hi>Jehozadac</hi> the high Prieſt before the captivity had Gods juſtice ſet forth in their names. But after the captivity, the great mens names ſet out Gods mercy, as <hi>Ezra</hi> an helper, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing comfort from God, <hi>Jehoſhua</hi> the High Prieſt taught them by his name, that God would ſave them. We have not that gift, yet may impoſe good names, that may put our children in minde of good things, unleſſe they forget their own names. So the <hi>Saxons</hi> in this Iſland gave their children good names, though now through the alteration of the language men underſtand not their own names. <hi>Edmund</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a mouth of troth, as <hi>Verstegan</hi> would have it, or bleſſed
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118645:13"/>peace, as <hi>Camden</hi> renders it: Like our <hi>Solomons</hi> name. <hi>Edward</hi> keeper of his oath, <hi>Frances</hi> free.

It were well if men would give good names to children now, that might be monitours of good to them, when their parents ſhall be dead.</p>

                     <hi>King.</hi> 8. <hi>Doct.</hi> If it be meant of <hi>David,</hi> it ſhews, what a great bleſſing to a State a good Governour is. He will ſee that God be honoured, and uſe his power, as <hi>David</hi> did, to ſettle the Miniſtery, that his people may not only be quiet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, but live with him for ever in heaven, where he ſhall be no Ruler, nor they no ſubjects. Pray then that our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours may be ſuch, and we enjoy Gods Ordinances pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under them.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. <hi>Doct.</hi> If it be meant of <hi>Solomon,</hi> it ſets before us the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of living under wiſe Rulers, who know how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect their ſubjects againſt all perils, and bring plenty unto a Nation, as <hi>Solomon</hi> did.

Hope of gain, or fear of diſpleaſure keeps back much, that might be taught. We learn hence then, that our Teachers ſhould not be almeſmen, but have a certain means, be the Auditors pleaſed, or diſpleaſed. Elſe are they worſe provided for in the Goſpel, then under the Law. No man then could deny Tithes, or Offerings. Their Office is not arbitrary, but neceſſary to the end of the world. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13.

And ſuch as have grace are imperfect, and very ſubject to be partial in their own caſe, and had therefore need of others to rule over them, and judge in their affairs. This reproves thoſe, that place all government promiſcuouſly in all the people with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect of Officers, and ſo by their creed utterly overthrow the fifth Commandement. How would an Army be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if there were no Officers in it? This practice would ſubvert Kingdomes, Common-wealths, and Families; for why ſhould not children and ſervants help to govern there, as well as private Subjects in a Common-wealth? <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> when one deſired him to ſet up a popular government in the City, bid him firſt ſet it up in his own houſe, and if the other liked it there he would ſet it up in the City. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>In the five verſes following is ſet down the excellent uſe of the Book of <hi>The Proverbs,</hi> and ſingular good that may come to us thereby. Before he had by a fair title, and large com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the Author ſought to make the Reader atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in reading it. Now he ſeeks to make him flexible, and willing to be taught, and to give credit to what he ſhould read by ſetting forth the excellent uſes of this book.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The general end is ſet down, verſ. 2, 3. ſhewing what it may bring to all men.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The particular end, what it may bring to young and ſimple ones, verſ. 4. what to wiſe men, verſ. 5, 6.</p>
                  <p>The general end is 1. Theological, verſ. 2. 2. Practical, v. 3. Both are called Wiſdom, and both are ſo. To retire to this 2. v. And firſt for the words. Many words here ſeem to be of the ſame ſignification, or at leaſt to differ but little. We had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore need to weigh the natural force, and different ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of each word; for variety of words is uſed to make us the more affected with the Book.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To know.</hi> To convey to man the knowledge of thoſe things he knew not before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wiſdome.</hi> In this verſe it is taken for the Theorical part of wiſdome, to know the truth of things, as appears by the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of manners in the next verſe. It may be meant of wiſdome in general, knowledge of the truth; for many Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopical truths are contained in this Book. But it hath a ſpecial eye to the knowledge of God, and divine truths, as appears, verſ. 7. And it ſignifies an exact knowledge of things by the cauſes, or other properties, whereby we may be able to diſtinguiſh between real, and apparent truths.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And Inſtruction.</hi> The word properly ſignifies the manner of teaching, by which wiſdome is attained. It is ſet after wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, becauſe that is the end and perfection of inſtruction, and therefore more worthy then the means. <hi>Finis primus in inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione, ultimus in executione. The end is firſt in intention, laſt in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</hi>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:118645:16"/>Men think of dwelling, before they think of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It ſignifies ſuch inſtruction, as is communicated to boyes joyned with correction, for the word imports both. To make ſcholars bred up under ſevere diſcipline to learn wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Theſe Proverbs are better then rods. They will teach, what rods cannot.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>The words.</hi> For thoughts cannot be underſtood. They are known only to God. Nor deeds are not ſaid to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, but to be ſeen. Underſtanding properly hath relation to that which comes in at the ear.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Of underſtanding.</hi> Words of weight worthy to be underſtood, and well underſtood by thoſe that delivered them, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from men of great underſtanding, and making them ſuch, that learn them. Acute ſentences full of good matter, fit to paſſe for authentical, like currant money. This ſpecifies what wiſedome the holy Ghoſt here meant, to wit, knowledge of things to be believed. As in the next verſe, he firſt names wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and then ſhews what kinde of wiſdome he means. <hi>To know juſtice,</hi> &amp;c. I will not trouble you with that, that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the interpreters, how to diſtinguiſh wiſdome, inſtruction, and underſtanding into knowledge by cauſes, or other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and many other diſtinctions, for I take it, the latter in each verſe doe but expound the former: and inſtruction, knowing, perceiving, and receiving doe but ſet out the means of attaining it.</p>

For divine wiſdome, which indeed is the beſt of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wiſdome, and deſerves to carry away the name from all the reſt. Humane truths are not to be named the ſame day with divine. So Chriſt is called the Son of man, Gods Word the Bible, and Scripture, becauſe he is the moſt excellent Son of Man, and it the moſt excellent book, and writing.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Of underſtanding.</hi> A figure, either of the efficient for the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:118645:16"/>as before, becauſe they came from underſtanding men: or of the matter, becauſe they contain things worthy to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood: As <hi>here is wiſdome, Rev.</hi> 13.18. that is, wiſe matter. Or of the effect, becauſe they breed underſtanding men. As pale death, becauſe it makes men pale.</p>
                  <p>For the diviſion, and arguments. 1. Note the general. 2. The particular. The general, <hi>To know wiſdome, and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> And in it 1. The act.

                  <p>The Obſervations follow. 1. <hi>Doct.</hi> In reading Scripture the end ſhould be alwayes before our eyes. <hi>Solomon</hi> writ <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs,</hi> that men might get wiſdome by reading them. So the builder ſtill mindes his end, whether he build for himſelf, or to let out for gain, and builds his houſe accordingly. It is Gods great queſtion in religion, <hi>To what purpoſe is the multitude of your ſacrifices to me, ſaith the Lord? Iſai.</hi> 1.11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon.</hi> 1. The end incites to the work. Much profit ſets the Seaman, Plowman, Tradeſman on work. <hi>Omnia in rebus humanis ſpebus aguntur: All endeavours in humane affairs are driven on by hopes:</hi> Salu. contra avar. <hi>Spes alit agricolas, ſpes ſulcis ſemina credit. Hope nouriſhes the husbandman, and makes him commit his ſeed to the furrows.</hi> Tibul. l. 2. el. 7.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The end orders all the means. No man can fit the means, unleſſe the end be in his thoughts. Workmen, matter, form, all muſt be ordered by the end.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The end attained perfects the work. It is imperfect till the end be attained.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Senſeleſſe things only ſet no end before them, as fire, and water. Beaſts have an end, they goe to the paſtures, and to the waters, that their life may continue. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> It blames moſt readers of Scripture, which travail to no end. They read a chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or make their children doe it out of cuſtome meerly, but know not why, or wherefore. Why ſhould Gods Word be worſt uſed by them? They work, and play for ſome end, but read for none, and therefore are never the better.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Doct.</hi> Wiſdome is to be gotten out of Scripture. <hi>Solomon</hi>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:118645:17"/>writ his Proverbs to teach men wiſdome. <hi>The holy Scriptures are able to make</hi> Timothy <hi>wiſe unto ſalvation,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. The wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were wiſe men, as <hi>Moſes,</hi> who <hi>was learned in all the wiſdome of the</hi> Egyptians, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.22. <hi>Davids</hi> wiſdome and <hi>Solomons</hi> are well known by their works, and reigns. <hi>Pauls</hi> alſo, who <hi>was brought up at the feet of</hi> Gamaliel, <hi>and taught according to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect manner of the law of the Fathers, Act.</hi> 22.3. As for <hi>Daniel, God gave him knowledge, and skill in all learning, and wiſdome, and he had underſtanding in all Viſions, and Dreams, Dan.</hi> 1.17. Thoſe that were not learnedly bred, had tongues, and wiſdome given them from God immediately. The Lord took <hi>Amos</hi> an Herd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and bid him propheſie, <hi>Amos</hi> 7.14, 15. He found him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, but he made him fit, elſe no doubt, he would not have ſent him. Some of the Apoſtles were Fiſhermen. But on the day of Pentecoſt, <hi>They were all filled with the holy Ghost, and began to ſpeak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance, Act.</hi> 2.4. From wiſe men we look for wiſe Books. But that which is more then all this, the moſt wiſe God guided their heads and pens, which had been enough to have made a man blinde and fooliſh to write aright, and wiſely. <hi>Holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Loſe not your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour then to ſeek heavenly wiſdome in humane writings with neglect of the Scriptures, as your great Politicians and Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts doe. Men ſeek it in many arts, buſineſſes, ſtudies, inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but in vain: here it is to be found, and abundantly more then elſewhere. Experience confirms it in <hi>David,</hi> who by reading the Scripture, became <hi>wiſer then his enemies, teachers, elders, Pſal.</hi> 119.98, 99, 100. <hi>Sapientia ſapida ſcientia. Wiſdome is a ſappy knowledge.</hi> And ſure the marrow of wiſdome full of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual delight is to be found in the Scriptures. It may better be learned here, then out of <hi>Lipſius</hi> his Bee-hive, or <hi>Matchiavills</hi> Spiders web.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Doct.</hi> Divine truths are far more excellent then other. Therefore are they called wiſdome here by way of excellency. Men may be ſpoyl'd by <hi>vain Philoſophy following mens Traditions, and worldly rudiments, and not the doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, Gol.</hi> 2.8. Philoſophy may be profitable, but vain in compariſon of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Doct.</hi> There is need of wiſdome to guide both the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and the will. For the underſtanding is blinde. <hi>Man is born like the wilde Aſſes colt, Job</hi> 11.12. Hence came ſo many ſuperſtitious among the Heathen, Becauſe they knew not God. Hence aroſe ſo many fooliſh opinions among the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, of merits, and prayer to Saints, and good meanings. Hence ſpring ſo many ignorant aſſertions among us, as that men have ſerved God ever ſince they were born: that they ſhall be ſaved, becauſe they have done no man wrong, nor none can ſay black is their eye. And the will muſt needs miſlead men then, for <hi>if the blinde lead the blinde, both ſhall fall into the ditch, Matth.</hi> 15.14. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Let us bewail our natural miſery, that neither know, nor care, how to doe well.

Here it is uſed in the firſt fignification to teach men how to diſcern right from wrong: Neither is this peculiar to Magiſtrates, but common to others alſo, for though all have not an authorative judiciary power either in Church or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, yet all have a power ſo far as concerns their own actions, to judge before, and after, what is fit to be done to others, and what not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And equity.</hi> Heb. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. Straight wayes, that goe on foreright, and even like plains when men goe not up hill, and down hill in their actions, but proceed in an even courſe. It comes from a word that ſignifies to be right, and equal. It is tranſlated taking <hi>the ſtraight way;</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.12. It ſignifies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a thing right in Gods, or mans eyes, which they approve as juſt and equal, <hi>Doing that which is right, and good in the ſight of the Lord, Deut.</hi> 6.18. Becauſe that which is right pleaſeth God, and ſhould pleaſe men alſo, although it be to their loſſe. Heb. <hi>Equilies,</hi> that is, all kinde of equity, or equity in all our actions, not in ſome only: or it may be the word wants a ſingular in Hebrew. Wiſdome then is required for the guiding of all theſe three, juſtice, judgement, and equity. Some think theſe three words to contain three ſeveral ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, but cannot well diſtinguiſh them. All three are found, chap. 2.9. Some underſtand by Juſtice the matter of our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:118645:20"/>that it be lawful; by Judgement the manner of them, that it be right; by Equity, moderation, that we uſe not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the law, nor doe all that we may. Others under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by Juſtice right actions, by Judgement diſcerning good from evill, by Equity integrity of minde in working and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning. Set out by the clean creatures in the law. The firſt by chewing the cud, ruminating on Gods Word to know what is juſt. The ſecond by dividing of the hoof, diſtinguiſhing between good and evill. The third by the fiſhes, that live in the clear water above the mud. So a right minde carries us above the ſinful wayes of the world. Others by Juſtice mean that which is juſt, and right by Gods Law or mans, by Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that which is due by contracts or bargains, by Equity that which nature dictates to be equal. <hi>Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris. That which thou wouldſt not have done to thee, doe not to another.</hi> Others take them all to be <hi>Synonymas,</hi> fignifying the ſame thing, and trebled to work more upon mens affections, eſpecially there being ſome difference in the notion, though the things be the ſame. Juſtice looking to the object, what is Gods right, what mans, what our own. Judgement look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the workman, who muſt diſcern the difference, that each may have his right. Equity looking to the manner of doing it, not going too far, nor falling ſhort in any of them. This laſt I think to be right, becauſe the former doe either interfere one with another, or doe not ſo well agree with the nature of the words, and uſe of them in Scripture, where they are often put promiſcuouſly.</p>
                  <p>Figures I finde none, the words being all literally to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</p>
                  <p>Here is firſt another general end of theſe Proverbs to teach us practical wiſdome.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. An explanation of it by particulars.</p>
                  <p>In the general note 1. an act. <hi>To receive.</hi> 2. The inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal cauſe. <hi>The inſtruction.</hi> 3. The object. <hi>Of wiſdome,</hi> or <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The particulars are three, 1. Juſtice. 2. Judgement. 3. Equity.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Doct.</hi> Matters of practice muſt not be perceived only, but alſo received. There is a piercing of truth into the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:118645:20"/>underſtanding, and a receiving of it into the judgement. <hi>The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man cannot receive the things of God, becauſe he cannot perceive them,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. So in matters of practice, there muſt firſt be a knowledge of them in the underſtanding, and then a recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them in the will, and affections, before they can be brought into action. <hi>The ſeed on good ground are they, which in an honeſt, and good heart having heard the Word keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience, Luk.</hi> 8.15.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon.</hi> 1. Becauſe they doe a man no good, if they only ſwim in his brain. What good doth a Phyſitians, Lawyers, Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans knowledge without a will to practiſe it for his own good, and others?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They attain not to their end elſe, but are like fruit falling before it be ripe, or a ſhip caſt away.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As the proper Element of truth is the judgement, ſo the will and affections of holineſſe, and righteouſneſſe. Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments out of their place doe hurt. A man knows, that there is a God; if he would be this God himſelf like <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> and challenge divine worſhip, he might ruine himſelf and others. So a man knows what is to be done, and believes it, yet if he have a minde to doe otherwiſe, much miſchief may follow. Air in the earth breeds earthquakes. Fire out of the chimney burns houſes: Earth falling in mines kils men. Water overflowing drowns cattell. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> It reproves ſuch, as have good heads, but not good hearts, illumination without ſanctification, whoſe knowledge appears in their tongues, not in their lives, and ſerves to guide others, but not themſelves. <hi>If ye know theſe things, happy are ye, if ye doe them, Joh.</hi> 13.17. ye are not happy for knowing, but unhappy for not doing, and <hi>ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes, Luk.</hi> 12.47.

                  <p n="3">3. By our ready hearkening to bad counſel, whereas good will hardly down with us.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By the diſparity of our condition. Men of great birth run as wilde courſes, as other meaner of education. It argues

We quickly erre in judgement, or practiſe. Ill opinions, or luſts will be ſure to ruine us for ever, if we want grace, and if God keep us not better, then we can keep our ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Doct.</hi> The way to keep us from errours, is the right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of Scripture. From thence ſubtilty is gotten to prevent them. All errours, and luſts come either out of want of a perfect rule, or miſapplying that rule that is perfect, or willingneſſe to erre, or doe ill. Ours come not from the firſt. The Scripture is <hi>a perfect rule, Pſal.</hi> 19.7. and <hi>able to make us perfect,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16, 17. God neither wants skill, nor will to give a perfect rule, as men doe. There was enough re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Old Teſtament to guide men of that age. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God forbids <hi>any to adde to it, or take from it, Deut.</hi> 4.1, 2. <hi>or to goe aſide to the right hand, or to the leſt, Deut.</hi> 5.32. which they might have done had they not been ſtrictly tyed to a perfect rule. It was impoſſible for them to erre then for want of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect rule, much more for us now, when it is more fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, and the charge of not adding nor diminiſhing backed with terrible threats <hi>of plagues to be inflicted, and the loſſe of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, Rev.</hi> 22.18, 19. To erre by miſpplying the rule is ordinary. <hi>

So was <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching miſ-interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to countenance lying and evill doing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.5, 6, 7, 8. To erre willingly is ſhameful. As for a man that hath a true meaſure and weight, willingly to ſhorten his neighbour of his due. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> It ſhews us, where the fault muſt be laid of errours, and luſts in our dayes; Not on God, for his rule is perfect, though many now diſgrace it blaſphemouſly, which have guided many thouſands to heaven.

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:118645:29"/>Their courſes are often oppoſed in Scripture. <hi>The wiſe in heart will receive commandements, but a prating fool ſhall fall,</hi> Prov. 10.8. <hi>The way of a fool is right in his owne eyes, but he that hearkeneth unto counſell, is wiſe. A fools wrath is preſently known, but a prudent man covereth ſhame,</hi> Prov. 12.15, 16. <hi>Every prudent man dealeth with knowledge, but a fool layeth open his folly,</hi> Pr. 15.16. <hi>The ſimple beleeveth every word, but the prudent man loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth well to his going.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Becauſe they work from different principles. A wiſe man follows the dictates of reaſon, a fool of will and affections. <hi>

So is mans heart and ſoul. <hi>Baſil. in princip. Proverb.</hi> A wiſe man like a skilfull Pilot looks on the Sun by day, and ſtars by night, his eyes are ſtill toward heaven. So he rids himſelf out of moſt intricate affairs, as <hi>Solomon</hi> did by wiſe diſcerning the right Mother, 1 King. 3.

                  <p n="3">3. Bleſſe God if he give you godly Parents or Maſters. It is a great mercy. Men do ſo for rich Maſters, where they may live plentifully; or skilfull ones, where they may learn how to get an eſtate; how much more for ſuch as teach us true wiſdome?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Make hay while the Sun ſhines. Make a good uſe of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticall inſtructions. God hath not given you good Parents or Maſters for nothing.

That will make thee excellently adorned, like a man that hath a crown on his head, and chains on his neck.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Doct.</hi> Though God might alwayes command, yet he often uſeth motives to perſwade. So in the preface to the Ten Commandements, and in the ſecond, third, fourth, and fifth Commandements, many motives are uſed from Gods power, goodneſſe, and promiſes. See the like Deut. 11. all over.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe God dealeth with reaſonable men, and ſo preſſeth reaſons. Every thing is to be wrought upon in its owne way, in ordinary courſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe their owne reaſon will condemne them, if they hearken not to God; but if God gave no reaſon (as he need not) then muſt he condemne men out of meer authority, which (though juſt) would ſeem harſh.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe of Gods in finite goodneſſe. He uſeth all means for the good of men.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> To ſhew the juſtice of the condemnation of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men; they fin againſt the light of reaſon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To perſwade us to hearken to God, who deals with us in ſo low a way, that might have ſtood upon high terms, and given no reaſon for his command. Princes uſe to ſay, <hi>Sic
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:118645:42"/>volo, ſic jubeo, ſtat pro ratione voluntas: So I will, ſo I command, and for a Law my will ſhall ſtand. Si regnas, jube: If thou be a King, command. Senec. Med.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Doct.</hi> Though we owe God more then we can do for him, yet he woes us by rewards. By temporall rewards, Deut. 28.1, <hi>&amp;c. Delight thy ſelf alſo in the Lord, and he ſhall give thee the deſires of thine heart. Commit thy way unto the Lord, and truſt in him, and he ſhall bring it to paſſe,</hi> Pſal. 37.45. Pſal. 128. all over. <hi>If ye be willing and obedient, ye ſhall eat the good of the land,</hi> Iſa. 1.19. <hi>Veluti pueris dant cruſtula blandi Doctores, elementa velint ut diſcere prima. Horat. Sat.</hi> 1. <hi>As kind Teachers give little cakes to boyes to make them willing to learn their</hi> A. B. C. Eternall rewards are promiſed, Matth. 10.41, 42. <hi>A crown of righteouſneſſe,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.8. <hi>A crown of life,</hi> Revel. 2.10. <hi>A throne to ſit on,</hi> Rev. 3.21. The Spirit of God here accommodates himſelf to Childrens temper, who love rewards. So ſhould men be taken with Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. To ſhew Gods freeneſſe, who though he might require more duty out of debt then we can perform, yet is pleaſed to reward our imperfect ſervices; as if a Creditor ſhould give a thouſand pound to one that owes him an hundred pound, and paid but five pounds of it; or a Maſter give to a Servant that failed in many things (though he were honeſt) treble his wages.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To work upon our ſelf-love. He knows that we look at our ſelves naturally, and he is willing to make uſe of this diſpoſition of ours to encourage us to his ſervice.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> This ſhews how great a ſin it is not to hearken to Gods voyce. If he required all out of debt, and gave no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, it were injuſtice to deny him. How much more when he offers ſo liberally? In ſo doing we juſtly deprive our ſelves of the good promiſed, and periſh eternally.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Let us willingly hearken to God, who deals with us upon ſo fair terms, as a City beſieged yeelds gladly in extremity upon fair quarter, much more upon great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and rewards offered. <hi>Moſes had reſpect to the recompenſe of reward,</hi> Heb. 11.26.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Doct.</hi> Hearkning to Parents inſtruction, is a means to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:118645:42"/>bring us to publick approbation. So it fared with <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf. He got approbation by attending to his Parents precepts, and adviſeth his Son to ſeek it by attending to his.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe the people obſerve the carriage of other mens children, as well as of their owne; and if they finde them reſpective of their Parents good counſels, they expect much from them, but little from diſobedient ones. Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient children are comely in other mens eyes befide their Parents.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe wiſdome is gotten by hearkening to Parents counſels, and that makes men acceptable to others. Keeping Parents precepts is grace unto the neck, <hi>ch.</hi> 3.21, 22. Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome made <hi>David</hi> eſteemed as an Angel of God, 2 Sam. 14.20. <hi>A mans wiſdome maketh his face to ſhine,</hi> Eccl. 8.1. God who <hi>turns mens hearts whitherſoever he will,</hi> Prov. 21.1. makes wiſe men to be had in high eſteem, even of fools, as if they were crowns and chains.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Let not children think themſelves too wiſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe their Parents counſel, leſt others ſet light by them. Whereas, if they hearken to it, men will willingly caſt their eyes upon them, and have an high account of them; as <hi>Joſeph</hi> pleaſing his Father, had a parti-coloured coat, that others might ſee his Fathers great affection to him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Doct.</hi> Hearkening to Parents inſtruction is a great means of preferment. As in <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who was the beſt, and beſt beloved Son of his Father. In well ordered Cities all men may not wear crowns or chains, but Nobles, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, and men preferred for wiſdome. <hi>Pharaoh put a gold chain about Joſephs neck,</hi> Gen. 41.42. <hi>Belſhazzar cauſed a chain of gold to be put about Daniels neck,</hi> Dan. 5.29. And this wiſdome comes often by Parents inſtructions. Men will not preferre ſuch to rule others, as would not be ruled by their Parents. Wiſe men are Noble-men, they have God to their Father.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Behold the reward of hearkening to Parents inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and be encouraged ſo to doe. Great honor follows it many times in this world, but ſure a crown of glory in heaven.</p>

Such ſeek to extinguiſh the good counſels of Parents at home, by drawing them abroad to wickedneſſe. For mans naturall corruption is ready to break forth, eſpecially being ſolicited by others.

                     </gap> Ezek. 24.6. <hi>Let no lot fall upon it.</hi> To ſhew the falling of it down, which did determine the controverſie. So <hi>Jonathan</hi> was taken, 1 Sam. 14.42.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond way was by a rod, which the Tithing-man had in his hand to ſtrike the tenth ſheep, as it came out of the fold, for the Lord, to avoyd partiality, Lev. 27.32.</p>
                  <p>A third way was by putting names or ſtones into a mans lap, or a pot, and he that drew out the right had the prize, as in our Lotteries. <hi>The lot is caſt into the lap,</hi> Prov. 16.33. As there is uſed <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to <hi>cast in;</hi> ſo <gap reason="foreign">

                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:118645:56"/>
                  <p>A fourth was by ſetting a ſtick or an arrow on end, to ſee which way it would fall, as the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> did to know which way he ſhould go, to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or to <hi>Rabbah;</hi> though others think it was the firſt way, by ſhooting an arrow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, as if he would ask God, and be reſolved by the fall of the arrow which way he ſhould go, Ezek. 21.21. Much like our caſting Croſſe and Pile.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. For the thing obtained by lot, be it land, office, wealth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As, the lot of <hi>Judah,</hi> Joſh. 15.1.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For an eſtate got by labour, or from Parents, or otherwiſe, becauſe things were anciently divided by lot. <hi>Thou maintaineſt my lot,</hi> Pſal. 16.5. And ſo it is taken here. For the young man tempted had not his means by lot, but by gift or labour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Among us,</hi> Heb. <hi>in the midſt of us.</hi> Thou ſhalt be put to no worſe then we are, nor fare no worſe. There may be much ods in ſetting one before or behinde, in war or robbery, the ſafeſt place is in the midſt.</p>
                  <p>Some interpret the words thus: Bring in thy goods to us, to make a joynt ſtock. We will be Partners. But Theeves need no ſtock to ſet up withall. Others thus: Thou ſhalt take that ſhare of the prey that falls to thee. We will eaſt lots to avoyd partiality. But that croſſes the common purſe in the end of the <hi>verſe.</hi> It is rather to be taken for joyning with them in their trade, which was as their lot, and brought in living, as others lived on their inheritances, which at firſt were divided by lot. So lot is taken for a joynt trade or courſe of ſervice or living. <hi>His lot was to burn incenſe,</hi> Luk. 1.9. <hi>He had obtained a part of this miniſtery,</hi> Act. 1.17. Joyn with us. We will have one way of living, &amp; that an eaſie one too, and live well upon it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let us all have,</hi> Heb. <hi>there ſhall be 'to all us.</hi> It rather ſhould be tranſlated, <hi>We will all have one purſe.</hi> We have a common
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:118645:56"/>ſtock already. If thou wilt live as we do, thou ſhalt have as good a ſhare of it as any of us, and never want, while we be worth an half-penny. So that it is their offer of a ſhare in the common ſtock with them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>One purſe.</hi> Some derive <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, to <hi>number,</hi> or <hi>gather tribute.</hi> For Tribute-money and other monies are firſt told, and then put into the bag to be kept. Hence come our <hi>Engliſh</hi> word Cheſt, ſuch as we put money into. When he ſaith <hi>one purſe,</hi> he doth not mean but one, to reſtrain it, as Mal. 2.10. <hi>Have we not all one Father?</hi> But a common purſe, in which he ſhould have as good a ſhare as they. They would communicate out of it alike to all. Our expences ſhall all come out of one purſe. We will live in common, we will never quarrel about diviſion of ſhares, but fetch thence what we want. One purſe here is the ſame purſe. And by a figure of the ſubject for the adjunct, the meaning is, The ſame money ſhall maintain us all. It is an anſwer to a tacite ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection which the Novice might make. Ye are more then I, and acquainted with the trade, and ye will expoſe me to the danger, as much and more then your ſelves, and give me but a ſmall pittance of the gain, as the Captains in war ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their ſouldiers to moſt perill, but take the greateſt part of the ſpoyls to themſelves. No, ſay they, thou ſhalt venture no farther then we, and live as plentifully as we upon the common ſtock. All this while they ſay nothing of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or loſſe, which muſt be borne equally in partnerſhip, becauſe they feared it not, nor would not ſpeak any thing, that might diſcourage the Novice, but all that might encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage him. As if they had ſaid: Forbear not our company, becauſe thou art young, and not uſed to fighting. Though raw ſouldiers uſe to have but a ſmall ſhare in the ſpoyls, thou ſhalt fare as well as we, that are thy leaders.</p>
                  <p>Figures. Lot for a Share in in their courſe of life. The cauſe for the effect. Purſe for money. The ſubject for the adjunct.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Doct.</hi> There is a communion of wicked men, as well as of Saints. <hi>When thou ſawest a theef, then thou conſentedſt with him, and haſt been partaker with the adulterers,</hi> Pſal. 50.18. <hi>They aſſemble themſelves by troops in the Harlots houſes,</hi> Jer. 5.7. Company of Robbers and Pirates trade as well as Merchants and Citizens.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe of likeneſſe of nature and qualities. They are the ſeed of the Serpent. Bad men combine with bad, as good with good. So wiſe men converſe with the wiſe, fools with fools, old men with old men, young with young. Birds of a Father fly together.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hope of gain unites them together. The more Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners drive a trade, the more hope of large income. A cipher alone is nothing. A figure alone is little, but figures and ciphers together make great ſummes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Their common hatred of good men, and ſuch as fear God. With this vice ungodly men are tainted. The ſeed of the Serpent bears enmity to the ſeed of the woman, Gen. 3.15. The rule is, <hi>Quae in aliquo tertio conveniunt, inter ſe conveniunt: Thoſe things which agree in ſome third thing, agree among themſelves.</hi> Husbands and Wives love their Children, and love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo. So wicked men hating Gods people, love one another the more.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Safety and impunity in wicked wayes. They can the better bear out one another in evil courſes, becauſe they are many. <hi>Vis unita fortior: Force knit together is the ſtronger.</hi> Therefore <hi>hand joyns in hand,</hi> that <hi>the wicked may be unpuniſhed,</hi> Prov. 11.21.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Take heed with whom ye joyn in a league, or in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, for all friendſhip is not good. There be brethren in evill, and they get a curſe, Gen. 49.5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Doct.</hi> Evill doers are very ready to receive, yea to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite others into their ſociety. So did the Phariſees <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe Sea and Land to make one Proſelyte,</hi> Mat. 23.15. So do Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Idolaters, Drunkards, Adulterers.</p>

                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. That they may have encouragement in ſin. <hi>Solamen miſcris ſocios habuiſſe dolores. It is a comfort to men in miſery to have companions in their grief.</hi> So it is a comfort to ſinners to have partners in their ſins. If their ſins be objected, Why? others (ſay they) are as bad as we. A yoke is eaſier borne by two, then by one.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That they may have help to act ſin. Some ſins are not committed with pleaſure without partners, as drunkenneſſe and adultery. Others not with eaſe or ſafety, as theft and murder.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> It teaches us to bewail the wickedneſſe of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that are not onely naught our ſelves, but alſo content to ſpoyl others at an eaſie rate. Merchants will look for a joynt ſtock, before they admit of partners. Sinners admit, nay invite men to come in for nothing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Doct.</hi> Much gain is gotten by unlawfull means. Many men by covetouſneſſe <hi>ſet their neſt on high,</hi> Hab. 2.9. Riches are called <hi>Mammon of unrighteouſneſſe,</hi> Luk. 16.9. Becauſe moſt commonly gotten by ill means.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe of Gods forbearance, who ſuffers mens wits to work ſtrangely, and though by unlawfull means, yet to raiſe a great eſtate. Sometimes baſtards proſper more then legitimate children, as <hi>Jephthah</hi> did, Judg. 11.1. So ill means thrive ſometimes more then good.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Out of Gods indulgence, who is pleaſed to give to bad men, who make no conſcience of bad means, a large portion, as intending them no more. <hi>Men of the world have their portion in this life,</hi> Pſal. 17.14. <hi>The rich man in his life time received his good things,</hi> Luk. 16.25. So <hi>Abraham</hi> dealt with the Sons of the Concubines, Gen. 25.6. And the Father with his prodigall Son, Luk. 15.12, 13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Take heed how ye get riches. Tradeſ-men uſe once a yeer to caſt up their Books. Would they would then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how they get the overplus. Theeves may be rich. Little comfort in ill got goods. Children will ſpend it as faſt. <hi>De malè quaeſitis non gaudet tertius haeres: Ill gotten goods joy not the third heir.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Doct.</hi> There is ſometimes not onely juſt, but alſo libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall dealing in robbers among themſelves. <hi>Have they not ſped?
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:118645:58"/>Have they not divided the prey, to every man a damoſelor two?</hi> Judg. 5.30. Though they be falſe to others, they will be honeſt among themſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. To allure others to their ſociety. Who might object, We muſt venture life and blood, What ſhall we get? <hi>Anſw.</hi> As much as we. I, but how will you be true to me, that are falſe to others? They anſwer, We are not ſo among our ſelves. We will be juſt and free to thee. Thou ſhalt fare as well as the beſt of us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To cover their ſin. Their ſmooth dealing among themſelves is a fair Viſard to cover their harſh dealing with others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> To blame thoſe that would be thought to be honeſt men, and yet will cheat their neighbors, friends, and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. Better dealing then this is to be found among theeves, and robbers.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Doct.</hi> They that draw others to ſin, ſpeak the beſt, and hide the worſt. <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s enemies tell others of hope to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt him by ſlander and reproaches, but never tell how God will protect his Prophet, Jerem. 18.18. <hi>David</hi>'s enemies encourage one another to rejoyce in his ruine, never telling that God would raiſe him up again, Pſal. 41.8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe this would ſpoyl all the plot, Bad purpoſes prevail not, where the iſſue is foretold.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe elſe they ſhould bewray their owne folly, that will do things themſelves, and perſwade others to do them, the inconvenience whereof their owne hearts know, and their owne tongues witneſſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Take heed of thoſe counſels guilded all over with fair pretences. They that mean well will tell inconveniences as well as conveniences. So doth Chriſt promiſe ſalvation to all beleevers, Joh. 3.16. Yet requires taking up the croſſe, and following him with ſelf-denial, Matt. 16.24. Beleeve not them that talk much of wealth, and nothing of hell. <hi>Paena non ſeparet, quos crimen conjunxit. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>na poena implicet, quos unus amor in crimine ligat. Bern.

(for it is the ſame word in the Original) he ſaith, <hi>Walk not with them.</hi> Walking argues a continued action. It is not taking a ſtep or two. So in the literal ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, <hi>Laban went to ſhear his ſheep,</hi> Gen. 31.19. <hi>Ye ſhall go after the Ark,</hi> Joſh. 3.3. So in the figurative ſenſe it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies going on in a wicked way. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that walketh not in the counſel of the ungodly,</hi> Pſal. 1.1. Walking then is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing. Have not converſe with them. <hi>Go not in the way of evill men,</hi> Prov. 4.14. Accuſtome not thy ſelf to do as they do. Sometimes it ſignifies the courſe of liveleſſe things, as of a ſhip. <hi>There go the ſhips,</hi> Pſal. 104.26. Here it is taken for joyning with them in their wicked courſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the way.</hi> As the former word ſignifies a continuance, ſo this word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, ſignifies a diſtinct courſe from others, as the way to one Town differs from the way to another. So in a literal ſenſe. <hi>We went up the way to Baſhan,</hi> Deut. 3.1. And in a figurative ſenſe, for a diſtinct courſe of life, good or bad. <hi>The Lord knoweth the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked ſhall periſh,</hi> Pſal. 1.6. Some take it here, for not joyning with theeves and robbers in their unlawfull courſes. Others, for not joyning with them in company or friendſhip, for fear of infection, though they be employed about lawfull things. Not to delight in their company, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe nature, or our callings binde us, or hope of doing them good. Much leſſe have one ſtock, or common table with them, as they would have thee do. Here it is taken in the

If Parents give good counſel, youths of our age, and ſuch as live by ſin, will give bad. Young men ſtand between both as <hi>Hercules</hi> in his dream, between Virtue and Vice, ſolicited by both.

                  <p n="2">2. There are fair pretences for all ſins. Gluttony is called the free uſe of the Creature; Drunkenneſſe, Good fellowſhip; Prodigality is called Liberality; Covetouſneſſe, Thrift; Luſt is intituled Love; Pride goes for Handſomneſſe. It needs a good Touch-ſtone to diſtinguiſh between Gold and Copper, well guilt over. No leſſe skill is needfull to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between true and apparent good.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Look higher to the light of Scripture. That will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you in many higher things; yea, thoughts themſelves. In a dark ſhop men will not be content with a candle, but bring things forth to the day-light. Thoſe things are ſincere that can bear the light of the Sun.

Neither will company of great or wiſe men excuſe us, for God hath not choſen many ſuch, 1 Cor. 1.26. Nor of teachers. They may periſh as <hi>workers of iniquity,</hi> Matt. 7.22, 23. Nor of good men. It was no excuſe to <hi>Barnabas</hi> his diſſimulation, that he had <hi>Peter</hi>'s company, Gal. 2.11, 12, 13. Company may draw our corrupt nature to ſin, but cannot excuſe us for ſin. Take heed then of bad company. Keep not company with bad men, no more then may be for thy good, or theirs, or then Gods Law binds thee.

                  <p>We come now to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s ſecond argument, to diſſwade the young man from joyning with theſe ſinners. And that is taken from the injuſtice of their courſe. They wrong others without provocation by them, or merit of evill in them. It may be the young man might object againſt the firſt argument, peradventure they had juſt cauſe to take the rich mens lives, as well as their goods. It may be that they have committed ſome great evil, or done them much wrong. No, ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> they had no cauſe at all to proceed ſo cruelly againſt them neither for any wrong done to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor others. It proceeds meerly from their owne cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, and cruel diſpoſition. They have given them no more cauſe then the bird doth to the fowler, to take away his life.</p>

So will Theeves go on till they come to the gallows, notwithſtanding examples of others hanged before, or counſels of friends. They will rob, though they be hanged, and for preſent content, they will adventure ſuture
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:118645:65"/>ruine. Their eyes are dazeled with the fight of gain, ſo that they ſee not the danger. Others take it to be in vain in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the fowler, who is not alwayes ſure to catch the birds, for many times they ſpy the net, and flie away. And this ſome apply to the Theeves alluring the young man. They often miſſe the precious things they aim at, the owners eſpying their evill intentions, and preventing them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore joyn not thou with them, upon hope of uncertain gain. Others apply it to the young man himſelf, as if <hi>Solomon</hi> had ſaid, If birds have wit to ſee and avoyd ſnares, thou my Son being a reaſonable creature, ſhouldſt much more (eſpecially being warned by me) ſee the danger of theſe evill mens counſels, and not dare to joyn with them. But the word ſhould rather be tranſlated <hi>without cauſe,</hi> as it is <hi>v.</hi> 11.

The one ſaith, they lie in wait for them cauſeleſly, and the other, that they take away their lives.

                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> To perſwade us to ſtudy the Scripture well, if we would be able to give counſell to others to draw them to good, or from evill; for there is the ſtorehouſe of truth, and abundance of reaſons, and ſtronger then either nature or art can afford, to work upon mens judgement, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Doct.</hi> Reaſons brought to confirm truth muſt be ſolid ones. So Chriſt confutes the Sadduces by a ſentence out of the Law. <hi>I am the God of Abraham, the God of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob. God is not the God of the dead, but of the living,</hi> Matt. 22.32. It is conceived the Sadduces believed only the five Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and therefore our Saviour out of them brings his proof, that could have brought plainer out of the Prophets, if he had pleaſed, as Dan. 12.2. <hi>Many of them that ſleep in the duſt of the earth, ſhall awake, ſome to everlaſting life, and ſome to ſhame, and everlaſting contempt.</hi> So he confuteth the Phariſees, who maintained that a man might ſwear by the Temple, but not by the gold of the Temple, by an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable argument; <hi>Ye fools and blinde, for whether is greater, the gold, or the Temple that ſanctifieth the gold?</hi> Matt. 23.17. So <hi>Paul</hi> reproves fornicators, in that <hi>they make the members of Chriſt the members of an harlot,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.15. So he confutes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Idolaters, becauſe therein they have fellowſhip with devils, 1 Cor. 10.20.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe nothing but truth ſhould come from an informer, elſe he may be a blinde guide, and fall, and lead o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers into the ditch.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Reaſons ought not onely to be true, but alſo to bear up other truths.

                  <p n="4">4. Our reaſons ſhould not onely ſatisfie others, but be ſo ſtrong, that they may convince them, and ſtop their mouths. <hi>A miniſter muſt be able by ſound doctrine both to exhort and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the gainſayers,</hi> Tit. 1.9. Therefore their reaſons had need be ſtrong.</p>
                  <p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Let us weigh our arguments well in our owne ſouls, before we preſent them to others. So men meaſure their corn at home, before they bring it to Market, that it may not fall ſhort.

The Lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and ſtrangled for his lioneſſes, and filled his holes with prey, and his dens with ravine,</hi> Nah. 2.12. <hi>Woe to the bloudy City. It is all full of lies and robbery, the prey departeth not,</hi> Nahum 3.1. So in idolatrous <hi>Iſrael, Ahab</hi> muſt have <hi>Naboth</hi>'s vineyard, 1 King. 21. It is full of <hi>lying, killing, stealing,</hi> Hoſ. 4.1. In <hi>Judab</hi> alſo profeſſing Religion in <hi>David's</hi> old dayes. It is like <hi>Abſalom</hi> had ſome colour of complaint, by reaſon of officers oppreſſion. <hi>No man is deputed of the King to hear thee,</hi> 2 Sam. 15.3. And in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in <hi>Samuel's</hi> old dayes. <hi>His Sons turned aſide after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgement,</hi> 1 Sam. 8.3. <hi>Samuel</hi> could ſay, <hi>Whoſe oxe have I taken? or whoſe aſſe have I taken, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Sam. 12.3.

                  <p>Here the Wiſe-man proceeds to a third argument, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the young man from joyning with theſe robbers. The firſt was from their cruelty, <hi>v.</hi> 16. The ſecond, from their injuſtice, <hi>v.</hi> 17. The third in this <hi>verſ.</hi> from their craft and indirect dealing, to bring their wicked ends to paſſe.</p>
                  <p>For the words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And,</hi> or <hi>So.</hi> For thus this word is tranſlated, Pro. 25.23. <hi>The North-wind driveth away rain, ſo doth an angry countenance at back biting tongue.</hi> It ſets forth a reddition to a ſimilitude. So it may do here. As the Fowlers without provocation, lay wait to kill the harmleſſe birds, that they may devoure them, ſo robbers without provocation lurk privily to kill men, that they may deprive them of their riches.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They lay wait.</hi> See on <hi>v.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For their own.</hi> It may be tranſlated <hi>their,</hi> or <hi>their own.</hi> And therefore the word <hi>owne</hi> is in a little letter, as not neceſſarily included in the Originall word. They that take it for <hi>their owne,</hi> underſtand it thus. Theſe robbers, that are ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous to draw thee into their ſociety think to undoe others, but indeed undoe themſelves in the end. They come to the gallows. They doe as it were hold a piſtoll with a dark lantern in their hand, and when they think to kill others, ſhoot themſelves to death. <hi>Quae rapinâ ſublata funt, raptorem rapiunt. Ab Ezr. Things unjuſtly ſnatcht away, ſnatch away the ſnateher.</hi> Some hold on the compariſon, and read it <hi>their,</hi> not <hi>their owne,</hi> and underſtand it of the birds, which the fowlers are not content to take, but kill them alſo. And they make the reddition, <hi>v.</hi> 19. But the beſt way is to read it <hi>their,</hi> and apply it to the rich men whom the theeves would rob. And ſo it is a part of the application. As Fowlers lay wait to kill birds, ſo theeves to kill men. The reaſons to inforce this interpretation, are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They that are to be killed are thoſe whoſe blood they laid wait for, <hi>v.</hi> 11. which was not their owne, but ſuch as
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:118645:68"/>they would rob. And ſwallow up alive, <hi>v.</hi> 12. And finde riches in their houſes, <hi>v.</hi> 13.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe the other interpretation agrees not with the ſimilitude, <hi>v.</hi> 17. for fowlers run no danger themſelves in catching or killing birds. No law layes hold on their lives. So it ſhould be a diſſimilitude rather then a ſimilitude. Though fowlers get no harm by killing birds, yet thou ſhalt periſh with murdering theeves, if thou joyn with them. But this agrees not with the words.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe it agrees not with <hi>v.</hi> 19. They ſeek the life of the owners of thoſe riches, and not their owne lives. To conclude, the dehortation is not taken from the hurt that might befall the young man, if he joyn with them, but that might betide others by his joyning with them in their crafty wayes, which will not onely be the loſſe of their eſtates, but of their lives alſo ſometimes, which the young man, not uſed to blood and fraud, would ſtartle at in likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, though the ſeducers uſed to it could ſhed blood with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remorſe.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Doct.</hi> Similitudes rightly applyed are of great uſe. They are much uſed in the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament. As by <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 32.11, 12. Where Gods care of his is ſet out by the Eagles tender care of her young ones. By the Prophets, Iſa. 49.15, 16. which ſets it out by the Mothers reſpect to her young children. By Chriſt, Matt. 13. who take ſimilies from Sea, Land, Trade, Husbandry, to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:118645:69"/>teach all ſorts of men piety. By the Apoſtles, Jude <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13. where the like are taken from Bodies of men, Heaven, Earth, Sea.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe they help the underſtanding much. For earthly things are better known to us then heavenly. They are glaſſes, in which we may ſee better things. The eyes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey much knowledge to the ſoul.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Similitudes help the memory, for things ſeen are tokens of things unſeen, as a thread on the finger of an errand. The act of memory lodges one thing in one corner of the room, another in another.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They help the will. When we ſee the willingneſſe of beaſts to provide for their young, it puts Parents in minde of their duty.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They help the conſcience. A ſimilitude helped <hi>David</hi> to ſee his ſin quickly, 2 Sam. 12.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He could ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne him that killed his neighbours Ewe-lamb, that would hardly elſe have condemned himſelf for killing his neighbor, and abuſing his Wife.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They help the affections. The attractive ones are hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by ſimilies taken from things liked; the abſtractive by ſimilies taken from things diſliked.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They help to amend our lives. The Ant can teach the Sluggard to labour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Treaſure up ſtore of ſimilitudes. All places afford plenty of them. Sea, land, ſhop, houſe, ſtreets, fields, are not barren. What can you doe that may not teach you ſome good leſſon for your ſouls?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Be ſure to apply them right, elſe they may doe much harm. As that parable, Mat. 18.23. where the Lords revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his pardon, <hi>verſ.</hi> 34. is applyed to falling away from grace, contrary to Chriſts interpretation, <hi>verſ.</hi> 35. God wil not forgive you, unleſſe you forgive others. <hi>Simile non currit quatuor pedibus: No ſimilitude runs on four legs.</hi> If it agree in ſome things, it muſt differ in others, elſe it were not the like, but the ſame. And what application can be better, then that which leads to the ſcope of the propounder? <hi>Theologia ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolica, non eſt argumentativa.</hi> Similitudes making nothing true, but illuſtrate things that were true before. The abſurdeſt
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:118645:70"/>thing in the world might be proved by ſome ſimilitude. As that Parents need take no more care for their children, then the Oſtriches do for their eggs, Job 39.13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But what childe will allow of ſuch a proof?

                  <p>For the firſt, the reproof. Wiſdome begins with a great deal of earneſtneſſe, as willing to perſwade. She out of a Motherly affection bewails mens continued errors, and kindly invites them to reformation. See the like, Pſal. 4.2. <hi>O ye Sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into ſhame? How long will ye love vanity, and ſeek after leaſing?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How long.</hi> Ye have continued too long in theſe wicked courſes. It is high time to think of returning to God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ye ſimple ones.</hi> Wiſdome doth not tell others of their ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, who may tell them of it again, but falls directly upon them, and calls them ſimple ones to their faces. Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome cannot flatter. She chides thoſe that keep childiſh man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, when they be men. The word ſignifies ſuch as are eaſily drawn to beleeve any thing that comes into their heads, or that others ſuggeſt to them, though never ſo er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous. <hi>The ſimple beleeveth every word,</hi> Prov. 14.15. See for the word on <hi>v.</hi> 4.</p>

                     <hi>Will ye love.</hi> Will ye be carried away with worldly vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as men in love? It is a weakneſſe to be ſimple, one to be in love with ones own ſimplicity is a madneſſe. <hi>Mala ſua amare malorum ultimum eſt: For a man to love his owne evils is the worſt of all evils. Sen.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. They could elſe do no good to men by their Miniſtery. He that tells a man he is in the wrong way, or that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my comes upon him, and cannot guide him in the right way, or to a ſafe tower, doth no good.</p>

                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe we are naturally in ſenſible of our dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, as a man neer death oſt-times feels no pain.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. Reproof rouzes up mens conſciences, and makes them look about them, as a roaring canon wakes a man out of a dead ſleep.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It enflames their affections, and makes them to look after ſalvation. As pain felt makes a man look after a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, that ſlighted him before.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe God is ſo free, that he gives the Spirit to them that go away from him; as to <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 9. Much more will he give it to them that return to him. Chriſt that ſeeks the loſt ſheep, will give his Spirit to the returning ſheep.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe elſe contradiction, untruth, double dealing, is put upon God. For if his Word ſay one thing, and his Spirit another, he contradicts himſelf, and muſt needs ſpeak falſely in one of them, for contraries cannot be true. If it be day, it is not night. If a man bid his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant before men to do one thing, and whiſper the contrary in his ear, Is not this double dealing?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe there is no other ſure way to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a true ſpeaking and a falſe ſpeaking Spirit.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> It reproves thoſe that croſſe the Word under pretence of the Spirit, and revelation, and ſo ſet God at daggers draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with himſelf, and make him inconſtant to ſay and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay. God in his Word bids read the Scriptures, hear the Word, ſaith, <hi>Paul</hi> the great Apoſtle knew but in part. Men deny all theſe by the Spirit. A lying ſpirit muſt it needs be, that contradicts Gods plain Word. <hi>To the law, and to the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; if they ſpeak not according to this Word, it is becauſe there is no light in them,</hi> Iſa. 8.20.</p>

Some take it for a tempeſt at Sea, that riſeth ſuddenly after a long calm, when men are ſecure, and lifts the waves up and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:118645:97"/>drowns the ſhip. <hi>Aquila</hi> takes it for an earthquake; and that ſuddenly ſhakes the earth it ſelf, and throws downe Houſes, and Caſtles, and ſwallows up men alive in the bowels of the earth. However, it ſets out an unlooked for, and unavoydable judgement.</p>

It imports any great grief or trouble of minde, whereby the heart is as it were ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and kept in, and oppreſſed.

Anguiſh and diſtreſſe grievouſly afflicting both ſoul and body, and all to ſhew how ſharply God will proceed againſt impenitent ſinners.

                  <p>The points we ſhall handle, ſhall be only of the conditions of wicked mens deſtruction, as they naturally ariſe out of the former ſimilitudes. Enemies lay a place deſolate quickly. Tempeſts ſoon throw down trees and houſes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Doct.</hi> The deſtruction of wicked men ſhall be ſudden and unexpected. <hi>Sodoms</hi> deſtruction was in a Sun-ſhiny mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning when they expected comfort, but were ſoon deſtroyed. Gen. 19.23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſſe were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed <hi>while the meat was in their mouths,</hi> Pſal. 78.30, 31. So the old World was unexpectedly deſtroyed. <hi>They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, untill the day that Noe entred into the Ark, and the flood came and deſtroyed them all,</hi> Luk. 17.27. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s caſting down, came ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, Dan. 4. and <hi>Belſhazzar</hi>'s death, Dan. 5. <hi>When they ſhal ſay, Peace, and ſafety, then ſudden deſtruction cometh upon them,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:118645:98"/>as travail upon a woman with childe, and they ſhall not eſcape,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe their ſins hinder them, and blind them ſo, that they cannot ſee the danger, till it be upon them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Their buſineſſes hinder them, and leave them no time to think of danger.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Their pleaſures ſo content them, that no fear of alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration can ſink into them many times, and then lightly dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger comes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Their hearts will not let them think of danger, but ſoon caſt out ſuch thoughts, leſt they make them melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 1. Let not wicked men flatter themſelves. Danger may be neereſt when they think it fartheſt off. It is more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to periſh ſuddenly then by degrees. Trees, houſes, ſhips, that are ſtrong are ſuddenly overthrown by a riſing wind. <hi>As the whirlewind paſſeth, ſo is the wicked no more,</hi> Prov. 10.25. <hi>Thou breakest the ſhips of Tarſhiſh with an Eaſt wind,</hi> Pſal. 48.7.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let them prepare for a better condition. They know not how ſoon they may loſe this. Who would live a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant at will, that may get a Leaſe of yeers, or a Fee-ſimple? Make ſure of heaven quickly, and then all will be well.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Doct.</hi> The deſtruction of wicked men is irreſiſtible. Who can refiſt a ſtrong invading enemy, or a whirlewind? <hi>And what will ye do in the day of viſitation, and in the deſolation which ſhall come from far? To whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory?</hi> Iſa. 10.3. <hi>Therefore ſhall evill come upon thee, thou ſhalt not know from whence it riſeth, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief ſhall fall upon thee, thou ſhalt not be able to put it off, and deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ſhall come upon thee ſuddenly, which thou ſhalt not know,</hi> Iſa. 47.11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe their deſtruction comes from God, whoſe power and wiſdome no man can reſiſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He can goe beyond all their power and wiſdome, though the greateſt that is or can be in any or all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He can diſappoint all their friends, and all ſupplies.</p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:118645:98"/>
                  <p n="4">4. He can ſet all creatures againſt them. And how can the ſtrongeſt creature reſiſt all other in heaven, earth, and hell?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> It ſhews the great miſery of ungodly men, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſiſt deſtruction. If an enemy come into a Land, or beſiege a City, if there be force enough to reſiſt, deſtruction will not follow; elſe all will be laid waſte. Wicked men cannot reſiſt God, therefore they muſt needs periſh.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Doct.</hi> The deſtruction of wicked men ſhall be totall, or univerſall. An enemy layes all waſte, Cities, Houſes, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens. A whirlewind or flood ſweeps all away.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. It appears in particulars. Their credit will be gone. Not onely their good name ſhall decay, but their name it ſelf ſhall be loſt, as a rotten thing ſtinks and wears away. <hi>The name of the wicked ſhall rot,</hi> Prov. 10.7. Their goods ſhall be gone. <hi>Thou fool, this night ſhall thy ſoul be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of thee; then whoſe ſhall thoſe things be, which thou haſt provided?</hi> Luk. 12.20. Yea, <hi>Cujus eris tu? Whoſe ſhalt thou be?</hi> ſaith <hi>Bernard.</hi> Their life ſhall be loſt. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall ſave his life</hi> (by ſinful wayes) <hi>ſhall loſe it,</hi> Mat. 16.25. Yea, their ſoul and all ſhal be loſt. <hi>What is a man profited, if he ſhall gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul?</hi> Mat. 16.26.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By the cauſes of it. Their fins are univerſall. Their thoughts, words, deeds, altogether ſinfull. Humours that run over all the body, make all the body ſick. They ſin againſt all Gods commandements, and that wilfully and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, and therefore muſt periſh wholly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Let wicked men labour to get out of this condition. A man would be loth to live in a trade wherein he ſhould get nothing, more loth to live in a calling wherein he were ſure to loſe all, and ſpend his ſtock. This is the wicked mans condition, get out of it, elſe ye periſh totally.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Doct.</hi> The deſtruction of wicked men will be irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. Such was the deſtruction of thoſe two rich fools, Luk. ch. 12. &amp; 16.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe they are carried clean out of the world. Here a man may be poor one day, and rich another; after this life, poor once, and poor for ever.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are carried to hell immediately after death, and out of hell is no redemption.</p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:118645:99"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Take heed of impenitency, leſt it bring you to irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable puniſhment. <hi>Bajazet</hi> the great Turk could ſay, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipiſcentia ſera nulli unquam profuit: Too late repentance never did any man good.</hi> Men inclining to a dropſie or conſumption, wil ſeek for cure before it grow incurable. Repent in time, leſt ye periſh for ever. <hi>Ad Deum redeundum, aut per Deum pereundum. Return to God, or periſh by God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Doct.</hi> The deſtruction of wicked men will be miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. Such was the deſtruction of old <hi>Babylon,</hi> Jerem. 49.25, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A ſword upon men and beaſts. Such of new <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> Rev. 18.7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Torment, death, mourning, famine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe it is helpleſſe condition. Evill men cannot help others, if they would, for they are in the ſame danger, and need help themſelves. Good men would not help them if they could, becauſe they are Gods enemies, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted by him to eternal deſtruction.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is a comfortleſſe condition. No eaſe or comfort will be afforded to them. Not <hi>a drop of cold water to cool the tongue,</hi> Luk. 16.24.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Let us bleſſe God, that frees us from ſo great a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, which we have deſerved as much, yea more then many that are in hell. Should not we praiſe God for deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from ſo a great a deſtruction, who <hi>are in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denmation?</hi> Luk. 23.40.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Doct.</hi> The deſtruction of ungodly men is lamentable. <hi>Jeremy</hi> takes the deſtruction of the people ſo to heart, that he wiſhes his head a fountain of waters, and himſelf in a wilderneſſe, to weep his belly full alone, without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, Jer. 9.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Kings and Merchants muſt weep and lament for the downfall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> Rev. 18.9, 11. See the truth of it in two glaſſes, one here, the other hereafter. The one in the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> who had dominatered over the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> yet at laſt the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſee them ſwimming dead on the Sea, Ex. 14. The other in hell, <hi>where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched,</hi> Mar. 9.44. This cauſeth <hi>weeping and gnaſhing of teeth,</hi> Mat. 8.12.</p>
                  <p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Remember the woe to them that laugh now, their ſtate ſhall be lamentable, Luk. 6.25. Wicked mens joy termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates in this world. Better weep for ſin here, then for puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in hell.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Doct.</hi> Affliction makes men ſeek to God, that ſlighted him before. So the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did, <hi>Their cry came up unto God by reaſon of the bondage,</hi> Exod. 2.23. When they were ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten down by their enemies they would pray, 1 King. 8.33.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. <hi>Poena aperit oculos, quos culpa tenebat clauſos. Greg.</hi> Men are dull ſighted in proſperity, and quick ſighted in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe they know not where to get help elſe. As the prodigall child, when none elſe would relieve him, thought of returning to his Father, Luk. 15.16, 17. Wicked men will try all wayes ere they will ſeek to God, he is their laſt refuge.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Suſpicion begins to work when trouble begins to
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:118645:101"/>come. Wicked men are often called <hi>Fools</hi> in this Book. Fools fear nothing, till they feel ſomething, and then they fear more then needs.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſcience then begins to terrifie them, ſetting fin before them in its colours, with death and hell attending it, Rev. 6.8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 1. To mitigate our ſorrows in our afflictions. They bring ſome good. They have honey as well as a ſting. They oftentimes drive men to God. <hi>Foelix neceſſitas quae cogit ad Chriſtum: Happy neceſſity that drives men to Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To condemne thoſe that keep aloof from God even in affliction. Men may keep out at Sea in a calm, but they that keep out in a ſtorm are deſperate. So are ſuch as call not on God in trouble. Sea-men will pray in a ſtorm, that ſwear in a calm.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Doct.</hi> Prayer is an invocation or calling upon God. <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble,</hi> Pſal. 50.15. <hi>They call not upon the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 14.4. A man that in want or trouble calls upon his neighbour for help, 1 ſees that he needs help, 2 deſires to be helped, 3 ſues to another for it, 4 to one that is able. So do we in prayer, confeſſe our want, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire relief, ſue to God for it, who is able to deliver us, Heb. 5.7.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> It inſtructs us in the nature of prayer. It is not with Papiſts or ignorant perſons, mumbling over words we underſtand nor, but ſpreading our wants before God, and ſuing for ſupply. <hi>O Lord, I am oppreſſed, undertake for me,</hi> Iſa. 38.14.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Doct.</hi> God will not give eaſe to them that never call on him but in trouble. <hi>They cryed, but there was none to ſave them; even unto the Lord, but he anſwered them not,</hi> Pſa. 18.41. <hi>Though they cry in mine ears with a loud voyce, yet will I not hear them,</hi> Ezek. 8.18.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe they had no acquaintance with God before. Men look after their acquaintance in time of trouble, not after ſtrangers, that have no dependence on them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe they look meerly after their own eaſe for the moſt part, and have no love to God, elſe they would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded his ſervice in their proſperity, Hoſ. 7.14.</p>

Let us then be mindefull of him in youth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Doct.</hi> Affliction makes men earneſt in prayer. <hi>In their affliction they will ſeek me early,</hi> Hoſ. 5.15. <hi>When he ſlew them, then they ſought him,</hi> Pſal. 78.34.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe affliction is compared to fire. <hi>When thou walkeſt through the fire,</hi> Iſa. 43.2. and fire will heat. So doth affliction heat mens affections.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe they finde much need of help, which in their proſperity they felt not. A begger wil pray earneſtly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> It condemns our cold prayers both in faſts and other times in theſe ſad dayes. If ye will not pray earneſtly now, when will ye? Wicked men will riſe in judgement againſt you. They pray earneſtly in trouble.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Doct.</hi> Prayer is a ſeeking of God. <hi>Neither do they ſeek the Lord of hoſts,</hi> Iſa. 9.13. <hi>Seek ye the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 55.6.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. He is as it were loſt when he doth not help us. <hi>God is departed from me, and anſwereth me no more,</hi> 1 Sam. 28.15.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He may be found an helper upon intreaty.</p>

                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Doct.</hi> There is a time when God will not be found of ſome men, though they ſeek him earneſtly. <hi>Though they ſhall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them,</hi> Jer. 11.11. <hi>When ye make many prayers, I will not hear,</hi> Iſa. 1.15. <hi>Then ſhall they cry unto the Lord, but he will not hear,</hi> Mic. 3.4.</p>
                  <list>

                  </list>
                  <p>For the the time. That is twofold:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. After a time of long calling on them to return, yet ſlighted by them. <hi>He that turneth away his ear from hearing the Law, even his prayer ſhall be abominable,</hi> Prov. 28.9. Yea, true repentance then, though it may deliver from the curſe, yet ſometimes not from the croſſe. God would deſtroy <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>
                     <pb n="194" facs="tcp:118645:102"/>for <hi>Manaſſes</hi> his ſins, though he repented, and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> reformed, 2 King. 23.26.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. After this life. It is too late to cry for mercy in hell. Not a drop of water to be gotten, Luk. 16. God hears not impenitent finners here, much leſſe in hell. Here is time of repentance, there none. The dore of mercy is ſhut up for ever by death, Mat. 25.10. When the golden time of life is gone, no trading for ſouls health. No phyſick after death. For the perſons, they are,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Impenitent ſinners. <hi>God heareth not ſinners,</hi> Joh. 9.31. Prayer and repentance muſt go together, elſe no audience.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Unbelievers. The Word without faith doth no good No more doth prayer. An unbeliever muſt <hi>not think that he ſhall receive any thing of the Lord,</hi> Jam. 1.7.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hypocrites, that have no religion, but in ſhew, and pray accordingly. <hi>Will God hear the hypocrites cry, when trouble cometh upon him?</hi> Job 27.9. Sure he will not.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Uncharitable men. A father will not hear them that are cruel to his children.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. It teacheth us to take heed of putting off repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. We may be in hell in a moment; or God may be ſo offended with our peeviſh wayes, that he will not give us true repentance, nor hear us. A great revenge. It would vex a man that his friend would not hear him in extremity. If we follow not Gods inſtruction in our proſperity, he will not follow us with help in our miſery. He that meant to ſay, <hi>Lord have mercy on me,</hi> cryed out at his death, <hi>Horſe and man, and all to the Devill. Perkins government of the tongue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us hearken to God in our proſperity, that he may hearken to us in our extremity, elſe we periſh eternally. <hi>Quid aequius? quid juſtius? non reſpeximus, non reſpicimur; non audivimus, non audimur. Salv. What more equall? what more juſt? we regarded not, we are not regarded; we heard not, we are not heard. I ſpeake unto thee in thy proſperity, but thou ſaidſt, I will not hear; this hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou obeyeſt not my voyce. The wind ſhall eat up all thy paſtours, and thy lovers ſhall go into captivity; ſurely then ſhalt thou be aſhamed and confounded for all thy wickedneſſe,</hi> Jer. 22.21, 22.
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:118645:102"/>To conclude, God will hear a penitent ſinner at any time; yea, even at the houre of death, as he did the penitent thief; but he often denies true repentance to thoſe that ſlight the means of grace, and alwayes denies audience to thoſe that <hi>cry not with their hearts to him, when they howle on their beds for corn and wine,</hi> Hoſ. 7.14. Let not then an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent ſinner ever preſume, nor a penitent deſpair.</p>

                  <p>The ſame things having been ſpoken of and handled before, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7, 22, 25. I ſhall onely inſiſt upon ſome ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Doct.</hi> Repetitions in Scripture are uſefull. Compare Phil. 3.1. with Phil. 4.4. <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord, rejoyce in the Lord alway, and again I ſay rejoyce. I will not be negligent to put you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in remembrance. I think it meet as long as I am in this Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, to ſtir you up by putting you in remembrance,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.12, 13. The ſame thing repeated in two verſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. They are great helps to the memory. Often reading imprints them deep there. Therefore in the <hi>Goſpels,</hi> the ſame Hiſtories, Miracles, Precepts, and Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Sacraments, are repeated. The ſame things are
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:118645:103"/>often found in the ſecond Epiſtle of <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Jude.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are great helps to the underſtanding, becauſe of ſome different expreſſions and additions. As in the doctrine of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper ſome things are added, 1 Cor. 11. which are not in the <hi>Goſpels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are great helps to the affections. Every new rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with delight works more love, or joy, or ſorrow, or fear. The oftener men view what they love, the more they like it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are great helps to practice. The more we ſee things in Gods Book, the more deſirous we are to ſee them in our lives.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. It reproves the queaſie ſtomachs of the people, that had rather hear falſhoods under a glittering colour of new truths, then the ſame things inculcated on their ſouls, though never ſo ſound. They like the ſame meat again and again, eſpecially if the ſauce and dreſſing differ a little, and why not then the ſame points of religion?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It calls upon Miniſters to preſſe the ſame truths. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion follows not new faſhions, as Clothes do. Hence come errors, for want of a good foundation. <hi>Plantas ſaepius ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aquare conducit. Primaſ. Gardeners often water their plants with the ſame water.</hi> God lays downe the reaſons now the ſecond time, why he deſtroyes theſe ungodly men.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Doct.</hi> God cleers himſelf abundantly in his Word, of the deſtruction of ungodly men. Had not God cauſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the old World? See Gen. 6.11. <hi>The earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.</hi> God examines the cauſe of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and condemns them juſtly, Genefis 18. So he deals with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 2 King. 17. with <hi>Judah,</hi> 2 Chr. 36. with the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> Rev. 2. with <hi>Laodicea,</hi> Rev. 3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe ſin the cauſe of it, is from us, and not from God. He neither compels, nor counſels, nor allures, nor conſents to it, but forbids it, and threatens to puniſh it. <hi>O Iſrael, thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf,</hi> Hoſ. 13.9.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is juſtice in God to puniſh ſin, and not cruelty, as in a Judge to condemne murderers.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God foretells their deſtruction in his Word, and by his Miniſters.</p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:118645:104"/>
                  <p n="4">4. He uſeth many means to prevent it. By mercies, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ordinances, checks of conſcience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. It blames thoſe who lay their diſhonour upon Gods head. He will lay it back on theirs, as <hi>Solomon</hi> did <hi>Joab</hi>'s murder, and <hi>Shimei</hi>'s curſe. <hi>Their bloud ſhall return upon the head of Joab,</hi> 1 King. 2.33. <hi>The Lord ſhall return thy wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe upon thine owne head,</hi> 1 King. 2.44. God will ſay, as <hi>Paul, I take you to record, that I am free from the blood of all men,</hi> Act. 20.26. In Sin-offerings, the perſons hand that brought it, was to be laid on the head of it, and not the Prieſts, to ſhew that God was not the cauſe of death, but the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Give God the glory of his judgements publick, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, on others, or our ſelves. He ſmites not without a cauſe. Say with the Church, <hi>The Lord is righteous, for I have rebelled againſt his commandement,</hi> Lam. 1.18. <hi>I will bear the indignation of the Lord, becauſe I have ſinned againſt him,</hi> Mic. 7.9. Knowledge is put before the fear of God as a foundation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Doct.</hi> There is no fear of God where there is no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. <hi>Who knows the power of thine anger? according to thine anger, ſo is thy fear,</hi> Pſal. 90.11. <hi>Who is the Lord, that I ſhould obey his voyce, to let Iſrael go? I know not the Lord, neither will I let Iſrael go,</hi> Exod. 5.2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe knowledge is the light of the ſoul. Men cannot work without light. Nor affections do their part without knowledge. <hi>Ignoti nulla cupido. Men love not, deſire not, fear not, hope not, without knowledge of the object.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Knowledge is the guide and mover of the ſoul. It ſhews arguments to fear God, as well as whom to fear. So the great wheel of the Jack makes the reſt to go; if it be ſtill, the reſt are ſo. There is then no fear of God without knowledge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> No marvell that many are ſo deſtitute of the fear of God. They dare ſwear and lie. They are <hi>Ignoramuſſes.</hi> They know not Gods power, elſe they durſt not do it; nor his goodneſſe, elſe they would not do it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Doct.</hi> Many care neither for the knowledge nor fear of God. <hi>Iſrael doth not know, my people doth not conſider,</hi> Iſa. 1.3.
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:118645:104"/>The unjuſt Judge did <hi>not fear God, nor regard man,</hi> as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf confeſſeth, Luk. 18.4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe knowledge and the fear of God are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to obtain. There are ſo many things to be known, and ſo high above Nature, and Art, that they are not eaſily reached. And the fear of God is harder to get then knowledge. For many get the one, and never come to the other.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They croſſe our corruptions, and curb them. The fear of God keeps men from many ſins, to which their corrupt nature would lead them. <hi>Joſeph</hi> would not wrong his Brethren, for (ſaith he) <hi>I fear God,</hi> Gen. 42.18. <hi>But ſo did not I, becauſe of the fear of God,</hi> Neh. 5.15. <hi>Joſeph</hi> lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked not power nor opportunity, onely Gods fear kept him back. Knowledge flies in mens faces after they have ſinned. Ignorant men are quiet after ſin, becauſe they know not that they have done amiſſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Be not offended at hard uſage from ungodly men. They want knowledge. <hi>Had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.8. Sure they want the fear of God, and then no good uſage is to be expected from them. <hi>I thought ſurely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will ſlay me for my wives ſake,</hi> Gen. 20.11.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Doct.</hi> Knowledge ſhould be the guide of our choyce. <hi>Now we beleeve, for we know that this is indeed the Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 4.42. <hi>We beleeve, and are ſure, that thou art that Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 6.69.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. It appears <hi>in credendis,</hi> in things to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved. How can men without knowledge tell what to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve of the World, or of the Church, or of the world to come?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>In agendis.</hi> In things to be done. How can men tell what is to be done toward God, men, themſelves, if they have no knowledge?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> We ſee here the ſad condition of an ignorant man. He muſt needs be an Infidel, and injurious to God and man, for he knows not what to beleeve or do. Knowledge is the eye of the ſoul. A blind man knows not, which way to take.</p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:118645:105"/>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Doct.</hi> They that chooſe not piety muſt be damned, as well as they that hate knowledge, and they that refuſe Wiſdomes counſels and reproofs as well as either. <hi>My people would not hearken to my voyce, and Iſrael would none of me:</hi> So, <hi>I gave them up unto their owne hearts luſt, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 81.11, 12. And what could follow then but damnation? <hi>Chriſt will come in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of Jeſus Christ,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 1.8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe theſe things ſtop up the way to heaven. Want of piety and the fear of God keep them out. So doth refuſall of good counſels and rebukes. And he that goes not to heaven, muſt go to hell.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They ſhut them up in the way to hell, and leave them no breach, whereat they may get out. Some men begin to be frighted with the fear of God, when they think of his power, or judgements. Others, that have no ſuch thoughts, are drawn out by the counſel of others that are eſcaped. Others that ſlight counſel, are moved with reproof. Theſe ſlight all, and periſh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Think not your ſelves in a good condition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye are not the worſt of men, and hate not knowledge.

                  <p>The ſins mentioned before were not about matters of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, or Morality, but of Religion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Doct.</hi> Sins in matter of Religion bring heavy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on men, yea on whole Nations. How coſtly was Idolatry in the Judges dayes?

                     <hi>Reaſon.</hi> 1. Becauſe duties of Religion more neerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern Gods glory, therefore ſuch ſins more highly offend him, as being not againſt his image onely, but againſt himſelf, not mediately, but immediately.</p>

The anſwer is ready, It may be ſo, but yet it will turn to their deſtruction in the end, as the Oxe to be ſlain, goes in the beſt paſtures. The Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine of proſperity ripens the ſin of the wicked. <hi>Bernard</hi> calls it, <hi>Miſericordiam omni indignatione crudeliorem.</hi> A mercy that he had no minde to; as being <hi>worſe then all cruelty.</hi> What good is there in having a fine Suit with the plague in it?

                  <p>The ſecond is, love of proſperity. Theſe two concur in moſt ſinfull men, and had before puniſhment anſwerable ſet down, to wit, Gods not hearing them, and their deſtruction.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Doct.</hi> God is content to give a reaſon of his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, though he need not. Here are two things to be proved:
<list>
                        <item>1. That God need not give a reaſon of his judgements.</item>
                        <item>2. That God will give a reaſon of them nevertheleſſe.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the firſt. God need not give a reaſon of his judgements. <hi>Who ſhall ſay unto him, What doſt thou?</hi> Job 9.12. <hi>O man, who art thou that replyeſt againſt God?</hi> Rom. 9.20. The Potter need give no reaſon why one piece of clay is made a veſſell of honour, and another of diſhonour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe God is of ſupreme authority. Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors need not give account to Inferiors of their proceedings: Inferiors muſt to Superiors.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He is in infite in juſtice. No doubt but his judgements are all juſt, though men do not alwayes underſtand the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of them. A man may be miſ-informed, or judge amiſſe out of paſſion, but God cannot.</p>
                  <p>For the ſecond. God will give a reaſon of his judgements, though he need not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe of his love to man, being willing to inform him of his proceedings. God will not hide his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings about <hi>Sodome</hi> from <hi>Abraham,</hi> becauſe he ſhall have a great poſterity, and will acquaint them therewith, and ſo bring much glory to God, Gen. 18.17, 18.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For mans good, that he may bring him to repentance. How ſhall the Childe mend, if the Father tell him not why he ſtrikes?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That God may cleer his owne juſtice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. It ets out Gods goodneſſe plainly before our eyes, who being above all, yet is pleaſed to make men acquainted with the reaſons of his proceedings.</p>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:118645:110"/>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us make good uſe of this information. Let us obſerve the reaſons of Gods judgements, recorded in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that we may avoyd the like ſins, and prevent the like judgements, for God is as juſt now as ever. Did he puniſh <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> for diſobedience, <hi>Cain</hi> for murder, the old Word for violence, <hi>Sodome</hi> for Iuxury? He will puniſh others for it now. They are examples to us, <hi>upon whom the ends of the world are come,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.11. Did he not ſpare <hi>Noah,</hi> nor <hi>David,</hi> when they ſinned againſt him? neither wil he ſpare his offending children now. Let us then be wiſe, and be ware.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Doct.</hi> They are ſimple that do not hearken to heavenly inſtructions, <hi>v.</hi> 22, 23.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe they are made acquainted with the greateſt danger to their ſouls, that can be, and yet will not avoyd it. If a man were told of a pit in his way, out of which there were no eſcaping, and would for all that run into it, were he not a ſimpleton?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The way to attain greater good then all the world can afford them, and that for eternity, is made known unto them plainly, ſo as they cannot deny it, and yet will not look after it: As if a man were ſhewed an eaſie way to get a Kingdome, and yet would live a begger. Is not ſuch a man very ſimple?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> It ſhews the great diſtance between Gods judgement and mans. Many of thoſe that are of great account for wit and policy in the world, God accounts to be very ſimple, and ſo they will prove in the end. They muſt prove ſo, that will not hearken to the counſels of the God of Wiſdome.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Doct.</hi> Not hearkening to good counſell brings deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. <hi>They deſpiſed Gods words, and miſuſed his Prophets, untill the wrath of the Lord aroſe againſt his people, till there was no remedy. Therefore he brought upon them the King of the Chaldeans, who ſlew their young men with the ſword, &amp;c.</hi> 2 Chr. 36. 16, 17. <hi>They eaſt thy Law behinde their backs. Therefore thou deliveredſt them into the hand of their enemies,</hi> Neh. 9.26, 27.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe it brings many temporall judgements upon men. God will ſet the brand of his diſpleaſure, and their diſobedience, upon them, in letters of blood.</p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:118645:110"/>
                  <p n="2">2. If it bring not viol nce upon their bodies, yet it brings both body and ſoul to perdition for ever. No man can invent a way to heaven. If he will not then go the way that God hath revealed, he muſtiperiſh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Let this drive men to hearken to good counſell. If the odious name of ſimple ones will not do it, let fear of eternall wrath open our ears and hearts.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Doct.</hi> Men in proſperity will ſeldome hearken to good counſel. <hi>I ſpake unto thee in thy proſperity, but thou ſaidſt, I will not hear,</hi> Jerem. 22.21. <hi>Woe to them that are at eaſe in Sion,</hi> Amos 6.1. The Prophet had little hope to doe good on them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe they think they are good enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They think they ſhall continue ſo, and look for no change. <hi>Becauſe they have no changes, therefore they fear not God,</hi> Pſal. 55.19. <hi>David ſaid in his proſperity, I ſhall never be removed,</hi> Pſal. 30.6.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Let rich men take heed, and not think themſelves too good to hearken to good counſell. They are in more danger then meaner men. Their ears are ſtopt with their wealth.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Doct.</hi> Proſperity and folly go often together. Rich <hi>Nabal</hi> was a fool both in name and nature, 1 Sam. 25.25. God calls the rich man fool, Luk. 12.20.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe wealth is not alwayes gotten by wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. It may come by gift or favour of Princes, or by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, or by painful ſervants, as <hi>Laban</hi>'s by <hi>Jacob</hi>'s pains, <hi>Potiphar</hi>'s by <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe rich men are from their youth cockered by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and flattered by others, which keeps them from the knowledge of the truth. Therefore ſaid the Philoſopher, <hi>Great men learn nothing ſo well as to ride well, becauſe the horſe will not flatter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Do not imitate rich men becauſe of their wealth. They may be fools for all that, and then why ſhould wiſe men be guided by them? An Ape of a Fool is very ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. Proſperity and folly are well joyned together, for where is moſt wealth, there often times is leaſt wiſdome.</p>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:118645:111"/>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Doct.</hi> Proſperity is the ruine of many. As of thoſe two rich men, Luk. 12.16. &amp; 16.19.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. It often makes men let go piety, and then as boys learning to ſwim, they let go their bladders, and ſink. <hi>Quando hoc incautis non fuit ad diſciplinam, quod ignis ad ceram, quod ſolis radius ad nivem, vel glaeiem: Proſperity to unwary perſons is like fire to wax, or the Sun beams to ſnow or ice. Bern. de Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratione, l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 12. <hi>Magnus eſt qui incidens in adverſa, non exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit à ſapientia, nec minor cui praeſens faelicitas ſi arriſit, non irriſit. Ibid. He is a great man, who falling into adverſity, falls not out of wiſdome; and he is no leſſe, on whom preſent felicity ſmiling, mocks him not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is harder to bear proſperity well, then adverſity. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Proverb is, <hi>The feet muſt be ſtrong that carry proſperity.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>Xenoph. Cyropaed. It ſeems to me an harder thing to bear good things well, then bad; for the latter make many a laughing ſtock, but the former makes all men wiſer.</hi> Peacocks let down their proud feathers when they ſee their black feet. <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Army having overcome the troubleſome <hi>Alps,</hi> was ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the <hi>Italian</hi> dainties. <hi>Tribulatio probat unam patientiam; proſperitas verò omnes virtutes examinat. Anſelm. in Sentent. Adverſity tryes Patience onely, but Proſperity examines all vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Proſperity layes men open to many ſins. To in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice in getting it. <hi>Qui agit ſemper faelicitèr, iniquè agit. Euripides. He that doth alwayes proſperouſly, doth unjuſtly. Quàm grave onus homo faelix inſipiens! nam ſtultitia germana eſt iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis. Aeſchylus. How great a burden is a rich fool? For foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhnes is ſiſter to iniquity Fortuna quem nimiùm fovet, ſtultum facit. Whom fortune cockers, him ſhe makes a fool. Mimus.</hi> And our Saviour calls riches <hi>the Mammon of iniquity,</hi> becauſe hardly gotten without it, Luk. 16.9. It is often abuſed to ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality. One rich man cryes, <hi>Soul take thine eaſe, eat, drink, and be merry,</hi> Luk. 12.19. The other <hi>was clothed in purple, and fine linnen, and fared ſumptuouſly every day,</hi> Luk. 16.19. It makes men ſecure. Living long in proſperity, they neither foreſee, nor
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:118645:111"/>ſeek to prevent their ruine. It hardens men in ſin, as it did <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. It brings Gods judgements upon them. <hi>Noverca virtutis proſpreitas; ſic bajulis ſuis applaudit, ut noceat. Convivis ſuis ab initio propinat dulcia, ut cum inebriati fuerint, let hale vulnus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſceat. Chryſol Proſperity is the Step mother of virtue. She ſo applauds her porters, that ſhe hurts them. She gives her gueſts pleaſant cups at the beginning, that when they are drunk, ſhe may give them a deadly wound.</hi> So <hi>Amnon</hi> was ſlain, <hi>when his heart was merry with wine,</hi> 2 Sam. 13.28. Is he happy that is ſtrong to kill himſelf, or that runs faſt, and climbes high to break his neck? Like thoſe that eating of the juyce of ſome poy ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hearbs, die laughing. It haſtens and heightens judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Dote not on proſperity, leſt ye deſire your ruine. I may ſay to you, as Chriſt to the two Diſciples, with their Mother, <hi>Ye know not what ye ask,</hi> Mat. 20.22. Are ye able to bear that burden? Rather uſe <hi>Agur</hi>'s prayer to God, <hi>Give me neither poverty nor riches, feed me with food convenient for me,</hi> Prov. 30.8. Many might have ſailed ſafe to the ſhore, if they had not put out their top and top-gallant. Keep then the golden mean, and be ſafer.</p>

It is not wit, nor wealth, nor ſtrength that can ſave thee, nor multitude of friends. Onely Chriſt can ſhelter thee from Gods wrath. He ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters none but his owne members, and that not in profeſſion onely, but in truth. Cyphers in his Arithmetick, neither advance themſelves nor other numbers. Try if thou be a true member of Chriſt by theſe notes:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If thou have another heart, as <hi>Saul</hi> had, when God made him a King. That heart becomes not a member of Chriſt, that became a limbe of Satan.</p>

                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe they are ſafe. There may be danger in following other counſels. None in following Wiſdomes. It is in Religion as in the State; folly ruling overthrows it, and not wiſdome. The fooliſh Pilot overthrows the ſhip, not the wiſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All ſafe things are not honorable, but Wiſdomes coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels are like <hi>Achitophel's, as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God,</hi> 2 Sam. 16.23. or like <hi>Solomon</hi>'s wiſe ſayings, which men came from far to hear. <hi>And there came of all people to hear the wiſdome of Solomon, from all the Kings of the earth which had heard of his wiſdome,</hi> 1 King. 4.34.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. All things honorable are not profitable. Many die honorably in fighting for their Countrey, that get nothing by it; but Wiſdomes wayes are profitable alſo. <hi>Godlineſſe is profitable to all things, having promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.8. Wiſdome brings happineſſe, and many particular comforts, Prov. 3.13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We ſee wiſe men thrive in Trades, when fools ſpend their patrimony.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. All things profitable, are not comfortable, as Matches made for money, but Wiſdomes counſels are comfortable alſo. <hi>Her wayes are wayes of pleaſantneſſe, and all her paths are peace,</hi> Prov. 3.17.</p>

We are too prone to hearken to fooliſh coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, as <hi>Abſalon</hi> was to give ear to the unſafe counſell of <hi>Huſhai,</hi> 2 Sam. 17.14. And to the ſinfull counſel of <hi>Achita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel,</hi> to go in to his Fathers Concubines, 2 Sam. 16.21, 22. The whole world fooliſhly hearkens to the unprofitable counſell of ſome idle ring-leaders at the Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> Gen. 11.4. The <hi>Jews</hi> to the uncomfortable counſell of their Captains, to go back into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> Jerem. 43.5. Let us for time to come, rather hearken to Wiſdomes counſels,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:118645:113"/>which are ſafe to the Soul, honorable to the Body, profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the State, comfortable to the whole man. And of ſuch counſell we ſhall never need to repent. It is ſtrange that the World ſhould call, and men run; the Devill call, and men fly; but when God calls, they will not creep.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Doct.</hi> Conſtant ſafety is prepared for good men. <hi>Truſt in the Lord, and do good, ſo ſhalt thou dwell in the Land, and verily thou ſhalt be fed,</hi> Pſal. 37.3. <hi>Great peace have they which love thy Law, and nothing ſhall offend them,</hi> Pſal. 119.165. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſee the good of Jeruſalem all the dayes of thy life. Yea, thou ſhalt ſee thy childrens children, and peace upon Iſrael,</hi> Pſ. 128.5, 6. <hi>For I, ſaith the Lord, wil be a wall of fire unto her round about,</hi> Zec. 2.5.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe they have a guard of Angels ſet about them by God. <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy wayes,</hi> Pſal. 91.11.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God himſelf is their guard. <hi>He that dwelleth in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret place of the moſt high, ſhall abide under the ſhadow of the Almighty,</hi> Pſal. 91.1. <hi>Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.5.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Doct.</hi> Quietneſſe alſo is the portion of Gods ſervants. <hi>When he giveth quietneſſe, who then can make troubles,</hi> Job 34.29. 1. Quietneſſe outwardly, if God ſee it fit for them. <hi>O that thou hadſt hearkened to my commandements! then had thy peace been as a river,</hi> Iſa. 48.18.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Quietneſſe inwardly. <hi>Being juſtified by faith, we have peace with God,</hi> Rom. 5.1. Quietneſſe in life. <hi>The meek ſhall inherit the earth, and ſhall delight themſelves in the abundance of peace,</hi> Pſal. 37.11. Quietneſſe in death. <hi>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright; for the end of that man is peace,</hi> Pſal. 37.37. In the grave, which is their bed. <hi>He ſhall enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to peace; they ſhall reſt in their beds, each one walking in his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe,</hi> Iſa. 57.2. After death for ever. None can paſſe the great gulf between them and hell, to moleſt them, Luk. 16.26. <hi>They rest from their labours,</hi> Rev. 14.13.</p>
                  <p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Woe to thoſe that ſeek to diſquiet the people of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:118645:114"/>God. They go about to croſſe Gods will, and he will croſſe theirs.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Doct.</hi> A good man need not fear any trouble. <hi>Thou ſhalt not be afraid of destruction, when it cometh,</hi> Job 5.21. <hi>Thou ſhalt not be afraid of the terror by night, nor for the arrow that flyeth by day,</hi> Pſal. 91.5. <hi>He ſhall not be afraid of evill tydings, his heart is fixed, truſting in the Lord.</hi> This fearleſneſſe proceeds,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From ſome inward principles. A good man may be like a ſhip at Sea, in ſuch a ſtorm, that he hath no anchor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room abroad, nor haven neer, all that ſuſtains him muſt be within: As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. An equall and proportionable ballancing by ballaſt, or goods. So a good man may have peace of conſcience, which may make him fearleſſe. He that knows himſelf at peace with God, what need he fear the wrath of all the creatures? Such may <hi>glory in tribulation,</hi> Rom. 5.3. and take delight in them, as in ſweet ſmelling roſes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The skill of the Ship-maſter makes them not to fear. God gives ſpiritual wiſdome to his, how to carry them in and get out of any trouble. Wiſdome onely can teach men how to keep an eternall Sabbath of reſt in the ſoul.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Labour of ſhip-men is needfull to preſerve the ſhip. <hi>Except theſe abide in the ſhip, ye cannot be ſaved,</hi> Act. 27.31. So God gives ſpirituall courage and grace to his, to hold up their heads in all troubles.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From outward helps: As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Gods protection. <hi>I will give peace in the land, and ye ſhall lie down, and none ſhall make you afraid,</hi> Lev. 26.6. They know that God who hath undertaken to deliver them, hath many wayes to doe it, and they reſt upon that, and are quiet and fearleſſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He hath a guard of Angels about him. <hi>The Angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them,</hi> Pſ. 34.7. But it may be objected, that good men have a paſſion of fear as well as others, and at ſome times are afraid of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. It may be anſwered, that becauſe no man can perfectly obey Wiſdomes counſels, they beſt in infirmity may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, but not quite overcome with fear; they will reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <hi>Fides non tollit omnem dubitationem, ſed vincentem. Faith
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:118645:114"/>takes not away all doubting, but prevailing doubting. Scotus in Sentent. He that walketh uprightly, walketh ſurely,</hi> Pr. 10 9. Perfect freedome from fear is reſerved for them in heaven. Wicked men dwel in fear, as ſtrangers; good men in hope, as inhabitants. Further it may be objected, Good men had need to fear troubles, for the world hates them, and doth often perſecute them. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Troubles may befall a good man, but he need not fear any hurt by them. <hi>Surely in the flouds of great waters, they ſhall not come nigh unto him,</hi> Pſal. 32.7. They can detract nothing from his felicity. He ſhall be happy in proſperity and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity. Trouble ſhall not be evill to him, but doe him good, and lead him to good. <hi>For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternall weight of glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.17. It may be God may ſometimes try his ſervants, but ordinarily they change their manners, before God changes their proſperity. <hi>Fortunam ſui cui<expan>

He is the firſt in the ſhip of fools, that buyes many books, and reads them not. To this purpoſe <hi>Solomon</hi> ſeems to ſpeak to the young man here, as if he had ſaid, I have and will do my part to fill thee with good inſtructions, ſee thou do thine in receiving them into thine heart, and keeping them there.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. The work is as good as half done, where a docible heart is. Poure in knowledge, and the veſſell will receive it.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe two things are required to make good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel profitable, that it be good, and rightly applyed. Good meat not eaten nouriſheth no more then bad.</p>

                  <p>We are now come to the ſecond way of getting heavenly wiſdome; namely, by learning it of them that are able to teach it.</p>
                  <p>For the words.</p>

Here is nothing meant but applying the ear, not to hear onely, but alſo diligently to hearken and attend to things taught. As a Muſician bowes his ear to tune his Lute, and the hearer afterwards, not in ſigne of any humility, but to hear the better. Yet the following word, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe ſome grow wiſer then their Teachers, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God gives them the overplus of wiſdome. Men cannot give what they had not.

                  <p n="2">2. When it is joyned with words of number, it ſignifies ſilver coyned, or money made of ſilver. <hi>Four hundred ſhekels of ſilver,</hi> Gen. 23.16.</p>
                  <p>Here it is taken in the firſt ſenſe. For the ſeeking here ſpoken of, is not taken from covetous men, toyling to get money, but from Miners digging for ſilver oar, as the words following declare. This may be taken either for mens care in digging in divers places, till they find a vein of ſilver, or for their labour in digging to the bottome, when they have found it. So when men want knowledge, they will <hi>wander from Sea to ſea, and from the North even to the Eaſt, they will run to and fro to ſeek it,</hi> Amos 8.12. <hi>Many will run to and fro, that knowledge may be increaſed,</hi> Dan. 12.4. From one Book to another, from one Sermon to another, and they will be diligent in the uſe of all good means, till wiſdome be found out. They know, that <hi>ſurely there is a vein for the ſilver,</hi> Job 28.1. Yet they are not ſatisfied with that, but enquire further, <hi>Where ſhall wiſdome be found?</hi> Job 28.12. It may well be, that ſeeking for a mine may be meant by this firſt part of the <hi>verſ.</hi> Cunning men, when they ſee ſprings iſſuing from the bottome of mountains, know by the ſand, or by the taſte of the water, where ſilver mines are. So muſt men gueſſe by goodneſſe of doctrine and life, where wiſdome is likelyeſt to be gotten. Men are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſeek in one place for a mine, but if they ſpeed not there, they dig in another. So muſt we for wiſdome.</p>

                     </gap>, ſignifies ſearching in generall, which yet is ſomewhat more then ſeeking. A
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:118645:122"/>man may ſeek that looks onely in ſome likely places, but ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching is looking in every room and corner of an houſe. <hi>They ſhall ſearch thine houſe, and the houſes of thy ſervants; and it ſhal be, that whatſoever is pleaſant in thine eyes, they ſhall put it in their hand, and take it away,</hi> 1 King. 20.6. This was a through ſearch indeed, ſo muſt the ſearch of knowledge be. Now there is no way to ſearch for ſilver, but by digging. Miners dig on, till they have got all the ſilver out of the mine. So muſt we dig for wiſdome as long as we live, for the vein of it is bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe.</p>
                  <p>

All things that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell other in their kinde, are of greateſt price. Beſt books are deareſt: Scholars know it. Beſt food is deareſt: Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens know it. Beſt clothes are deereſt: Gentlemen know it.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:118645:123"/>So ſhould the beſt knowledge be of beſt account. <hi>All the earth ſought to Solomon, to hear his wiſdome,</hi> 1 King. 10.24.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is moſt uſefull. Other wiſdome tends to, and ends in the comforts of this tranſitory life, for to get houſes, food, apparell, which muſt periſh. This wiſdome looks after eternity.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Doct.</hi> Heavenly wiſdome is far remote and hidden from us. As mines buryed deep in the earth. It is hid from <hi>the eyes of all living, &amp;c.</hi> Job 28.20. <hi>It is to the Jews a ſtumbling block, and unto the Greeks fooliſhneſſe,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.23.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe it is beyond our invention. Many witty things have been invented by men, but no man ſo wiſe, that could ever ſtumble upon the way to heaven. <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time; the onely begotten Son, which is in the boſome of the Father, he hath declared him,</hi> Joh. 1.18.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is beyond our apprehenſion. Senſe and reaſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out illumination cannot conceive of divine truths manifeſted to us in Scripture. <hi>Thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them unto babes,</hi> Matth. 11.25. <hi>The naturall man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.14.</p>

                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe God doth not work by miracle now, as he did, when he gave tongues, and healing power, Act. 2.3, 4.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Doct.</hi> We muſt uſe the means when we finde them.

                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe God hath appointed them. And his will is a law to us, to uſe them, although we had no need of them, or thought other means better, as <hi>Naaman</hi> thought his <hi>Syrian</hi> rivers better then <hi>Jordan,</hi> 2 King. 5.12.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe we have great need of them, and cannot attain true wiſdome without them.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> It cryes down thoſe that cry down Gods ordinances. They had need put this text out of the Bible. It will be a ſtrong witneſſe againſt them elſe at the day of judgement. Men will dig in Gold mines, yea in Coal mines, while any thing is left. They can never dig the Scripture dry. But men of this generation are wiſer for the world, then for heaven.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>D.</hi> We muſt take pains in the uſe of the means of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. So do men in digging for ſilver. <hi>We muſt watch daily at Wiſdomes gates, and wait at the poſts of her dores,</hi> ch. 8.34. <hi>Give attendance to reading,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe worldly men take ſo much pains for wealth, which is not to be compared to knoweldge. Miners take great care, ſtudy, pains, and are at great coſt; and ſpend much time to get gold and ſilver out of the earth, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:118645:124"/>to purge it from the droſſe. Merchants are at much coſt, and run many dangers by ſtorms and Pirats to get gain. All their heart runs after it. So ſhould ours after wiſdome. <hi>Omnis cupiditas in illam tendatur.</hi> We ſhould ſeek it with as vehement deſire, as covetous men ſeek after money. Not that covetouſneſſe is to be commended, but that we ſhould be aſhamed not to ſeek after wiſdome ſo earneſtly, as they do after riches. See how patiently they that love money, labour and ſweat for it, forbear pleaſure, and delight, take all occaſions of gain, avoid all occaſions of loſſe. And we do not ſo much for heavenly wiſdome, which is far better. For riches diminiſh by uſe, wiſdome encreaſes. So Chriſts coming is ſet out by a theeve's in the night, 1 Theſſ. 5.2. We are ſpoken to here after the manner of men, Rom. 6.19. For wiſdome ſhould be ſought with more diligence then riches.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe though God could give it us without our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, yet he will not, that we may the more eſteem it, being hardly gotten. So Husbandmen, Shepherds, Gardiners, Labourers, Inkeepers, Merchants, learn Languages, Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick, incur many dangers. <hi>Per mare pauperiem fugiens, per ſaxa, per ignes, Impiger extremos currens Mercator ad Indos. Horat. The greedy Merchant runs to the Indies through ſea, rocks, and fires to avoyd poverty.</hi> The unjuſt Steward cannot dig. It requires no great skill, but is too great a labour for him, Luk. 16.3.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe we muſt not <hi>fodere</hi> only, but <hi>effodere;</hi> not only dig, but dig out. All the Diggers labour is loſt, if he dig not till he dig the oar out of the ground. Yea, men dig till they dig it all out. So muſt we labour till we attain the height of knowledge.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The pleaſure and profit will anſwer all the pains. It brings happineſſe and better profit then merchandiſe of gold and ſilver, <hi>chap.</hi> 3.13, 14. It will make amends if a man ſell all he hath for it, Matth. 13.44. The fruit is anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the labour. The treaſure anſwers the Miners pains, and fills him with joy, when his labour is done. He fares the better for it all his life long.</p>

Sudor ante virtutem poſitus: Sweat goes before virtue. Clem. Strom. l.</hi> 4. A man muſt climbe or dig for it, if he will have it. Worldly men dig where they have hope of a Mine, though with much uncertainty.

                  <p>

                  <p n="1">1. Incluſively, when thou haſt uſed all the former means, thou mayſt expect it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Excluſively. Never look for it, till thou have uſed them all.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Doct.</hi> Men that conſcionably uſe all means of getting true wiſdome, appointed by God, may expect good ſucceſſe from him. So did <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeed, who records his Fathers inſtructions, from <hi>ch.</hi> 4.4. to <hi>ch.</hi> 9. <hi>end,</hi> and his Mothers, <hi>ch.</hi> 31. He alſo uſed ſtudy, and gave his heart to it, Eccl. 1.13. He prayed for it, 2 Chr. 1.10. and ſo got a great meaſure of it. <hi>Meditate upon theſe things, give thy ſelf wholly to them, that thy profiting may appear to all,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.15.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe elſe Gods promiſe is voyd, and then his truth will be queſtioned. Men may fail of performing promiſes, for want of wit to foreſee inconveniences, and power to effect what they ſay. But God wants neither.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The means appointed by God would be ſlighted. Who would ever ſtudy Law or phyſick, if after all his pains he could not attain to the profitable knowledge of them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Let this encourage you to ſtudy for true wiſdome. Here is a fair promiſe, God will not fail us, if we take pains to get wiſdome. Many of the people fooliſhly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that they cannot know the way to true wiſdome. Great Scholars cannot agree upon it. Sure if they ſought as diligently by reading the Scriptures and Prayer, and other good means, as they and others labour for wealth, they would find wiſdome. The rich young man came to Chriſt, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firous to learn, yet preferring his wealth before true wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, went without it. When men ſee Merchants returne home rich, and Husband-men have great crops, they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to thoſe Trades. So ſhould we be encouraged to ſeek wiſdome by what others have got. Try the means, and let what you get encourage you to ſeek for more; as men work ſtill, and harder in their Trades, when gain comes. <hi>Salomon</hi> finding his <hi>Ophir</hi> trade for gold to thrive, 1 King.
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:118645:127"/>9.28. ſent thither every three yeers, 1 King. 10.22. So let us be encouraged by what we have got already, to get more wiſdome.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Doct.</hi> There is no expectation of attaining true wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, without a conſcionable uſe of all good means. The Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not obtain true wiſdome, nor the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> becauſe they uſed not the means pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to them to cauſe the Law to be written out for them, and to read therein all the dayes of their life, Deut. 17.18, 19, 20.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe God will not bleſſe their labours, that go not his way. They may as well expect ſtrength without food, health without phyſick, warmth without clothes or fire, crops without plowing or ſowing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God will croſſe thoſe that go their owne wayes to get wiſdome. For they aſcribe to themſelves a power above God, and a wiſdome ſutable, that pull down his way to ſet up another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> It ſhews us a reaſon why many have not true wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, becauſe they ſeek it not in Gods way, and God will not give it in theirs. They have no mind to learn it, hear ſeldome, pray ſeldomer, never ſtudy.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Doct.</hi> Much wiſdome is needfull to find out the true religion. <hi>Timothy from a childe had learned the holy Scriptures, which were able to make him wiſe to ſalvation,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.15. <hi>The wiſdome that is from above, is firſt pure, then peaceable, &amp;c.</hi> Jam. 3.17.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe it is high above us; ſenſe nor reaſon cannot reach it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There are many ſhews of falſe religions to deceive us. As <hi>voluntary humility, and worſhipping of Angels; a ſhew of wiſdome in will-worſhip, &amp;c.</hi> Col. 2.18.23. All is not gold that gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>

They think themſelves wifer then they are. <hi>Vainman would be wiſe, though man be born like a wild Aſſes colt,</hi> Job 11.12. The name here given to God is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>being.</hi>

You may learn humane wiſdome from <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> but divine wiſdome is not to be ſought in the books of Heathen writers, and Infidels, but in thoſe books which come out of Gods owne mouth. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſends us thither for it, from whence he had it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>Origo fontium, &amp; fluminum omnium mare eſt: virtutum, &amp; ſcientiarum, Dominus Jeſus Chriſtus.

                  <p n="2">2. Take notice that our wiſdome is not from our ſelves, but from God. It is not in our power to get it. Be not then proud of thy wiſdome, as if God were a debtor to thee for uſing thy wiſdome to his glory.

This path in Scripture is more ſure, then if God ſhould ſpeak from heaven. There was <hi>a voyce from heaven.</hi> But there was <hi>a more ſure word of propheſie,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.17, 19.

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:118645:137"/>is no pleaſing a man without knowing his qualities.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is no eſcaping hell without a certain rule of truth; for our nature being corrupt, and there being many wayes of error leading to hell, no man can eſcape damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> It ſhews the wildneſſe of thoſe that plead for liberty of conſcience for all errors. As if a man ſhould inform the State that there were no certain way to <hi>London,</hi> and petition that all men might go at all adventures, and no man be tied to go the ordinary way, but every one go what way he thinks to be neereſt, over hedges and ditches, and over mens grounds and gardens. Ye will ſay this were injurious to men. But are not hereſies and blaſphemies more injurious to God? Are not mens conſciences as corrupt as their wils and affections? Why then ſhould not others petition for liberty of will and affections, to love whom they will, and hate whom they will? The beſt is, that the Text tells us, that God keeps his in the way of judgement. If men will not keep theirs within their bounds, God will keep his. However, there is a right way, and men ought to labour to keep themſelves and theirs in it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Doct.</hi> Good men muſt keep in the ſure way of truth. <hi>We have alſo a more ſure word of propheſie, whereunto ye do well, that ye take heed,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.19. <hi>Beware, leſt ye be led away with the error of the wicked, and fall from your owne ſtedfaſtneſſe,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.17.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. There are many duties in every commandement that concerns men, as fear of offending unjuſtly, loving carriage, good example, counſel, liberality, patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. There are many faculties of the ſoul, and members of the body to be imployed in every duty, as the Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, Will, Affection, Tongue, Hand, Foot.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There are many objects of duty to man. All ſorts of men, friends, enemies, ſtrangers. Men of all conditions, rich, poor, wiſe, fooliſh, whole, ſick. In all things that concern them, to help them in their ſouls, bodies, ſtates, chaſtity, good name, contentedneſſe. And what pains is ſufficient to underſtand all theſe particulars?</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To reprove them that take no care to breed their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſo as they may know how to carry themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others, but rather bear them out in wronging other men.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Doct.</hi> God will give ſuch wiſdome to thoſe that ſeek it, that they ſhall know how to carry themſelves towards others. So God taught <hi>Joſeph</hi> how to get reſpect among ſtrangers, in <hi>Potiphar</hi>'s houſe, in the priſon, and in <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Court, Gen. 39.4, 21.22. &amp; 45 16. God taught <hi>David</hi> how to get the favour of the people, 1 Sam. 18.5, 6.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe God loves concord among men. See how he commends it, and ſets it out by excellent ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, of precious oyntment, and dew, and pronounces a bleſſing upon it, Pſal. 133. There can be no concord, where men know not how to offer right, nor ſuffer wrong.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God would have the praiſe of it, both of giving it, and of the fruits of it. Men agree not well whom God joyns not in affection.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. All the comfort of the Common-wealth depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mens good carriage one towards another.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Churches good depends upon the good carriage of every member, even of the meaneſt, as the Bodies do, 1 Cor. 12. God would have Church and Common-wealth to flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, if mens ſins hinder not.</p>

To reprove ſuch as ſeek not this wiſdome from God, but carry themſelves proudly, and look that all men ſhould do duty, and more then duty to them, but care not ſo much as to take notice of any reſpect they owe to others, or ſhewed to them by others. They are far from <hi>Job</hi>'s minde, who <hi>did not deſpiſe the cauſe of his Man ſervant, or of his Maid-ſervant, when they contended with him,</hi> Job 31.13.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To blame ſuch as have this wiſdome given them from God, to carry themſelves wiſely and well towards others, but bring up their children ſo fondly, that they neither know what they owe to their parents, nor to any elſe. Theſe ruine their parents eſtates, and prove the ruine of Church and Common-wealth. Such cannot look that God ſhould give wiſdome to them or theirs, nor look that any man ſhould regard them.</p>

                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe wiſdome ſhews the right end we ſhould aim at, the right means to attain that end, and the fitteſt time to uſe thoſe means. And all theſe help to preſerve us from ſin, judgement, evill practiſes; from dangers, corporal, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, and from hell it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It teaches a man how to make uſe of all times; of time paſt, elſe you loſe your life; of time preſent, elſe ye live ill; of time to come, elſe ye lie open to all dangers. <hi>Whoſo keepeth the commandement, ſhal feel no evill thing; and a wiſe mans heart diſcerneth both time and judgement.

Ye are naturally careleſſe, watchfulneſſe will keep ye out of them. Thinking often of perill, is the way to prevent perill. Other virtues are armed ſouldiers in the field, ready to fight for the ſouls ſafety. Wiſdome is the Watchman or Sentinel of the ſoul, to foretell danger. <hi>Salazar.</hi> Where wiſdome enters not into the heart, there are no ſaving thoughts, nor counſels, whereby men may be ſafe; for the inconſtancy of mans mind is wonderful, and the blindneſſe and frailty of it great. Men think more frequently of vain and pernicious things, then of honeſt and godly, unleſſe wiſdome be preſent, which may ſupply hearty and heavenly thoughts, which may ſhut up the entrance againſt

It was a great mercy of God to keep <hi>Joſeph</hi> from adultery, Gen. 39.10. <hi>David</hi> found not ſo much favour from God, 2 Sam. 11. <hi>Tibi deputo peccata, quae non feci.

                  <p>The third note of a wicked man follows, which is the expreſſion of his affections in the content he takes in doing evill, and joy in ſinfull courſes. The Wiſe-man counts them wicked, who are grown to ſuch an height of impiety, that they take pleaſure in the many and great ſins they have committed; or do commit and triumph in groſſe ſins done by them, or by others at their perſwaſion, or in their ſight or hearing. This diſorder of affections much aggravates the naughtineſſe of their words and actions. They not onely do evill, but come to it with much deſire, and practiſe it with much delight. Men that have not onely a diſpoſition to doe evil, but an habit alſo, and are hardned in ſin. This is the reaſon why they leave good wayes to walk in bad, becauſe they delight in doing evill. In the former <hi>chap. verſ.</hi> 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he diſſwades the young man from ſinning for profit; here he warns him to take heed of ſinfull pleaſures. He had before ſet out the pleaſure wiſdome brings to keep us from the pleaſures of ſin. It is not enough that they do any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, but they rejoyce in doing thoſe things that nature and reaſon forbid. They are in the dark, <hi>v.</hi> 13. and ſee not their danger. Yet rejoyce they in their deeds of darkneſſe. This aggravates their blindneſſe, as well as their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.

                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe this is a great help to the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as ſpectacles to the eyes. By worldly things which we know, we are taught heavenly things, which we know not.</p>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:118645:157"/>
                  <p n="2">2. It is a great help to the memory. Things that we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get (as we are very ready to forget things belonging to the ſoules good) are brought to our mind upon the fight, and hearing of thoſe metaphors.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It works much upon the affections. Many outward things are very pleaſing to us. By comparing ſpirituall things to thoſe things we love, and take comfort in in the world, our affections are drawn higher. Therefore God is called a Father and an husband.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It workes upon the conſcience. I am Gods ſervant, child, wife. When I ſee the carefulneſſe of mine to do duty to me, my conſcience ſmites me, and tels me, I am not ſo carefull to do duty to God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. It condemnes the Papiſts, who in many points to confirme their erroneous opinions turn metaphors into a literall ſenſe. As to prove that children, who die unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, cannot be ſaved, they interpret that <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward water in Baptiſme, which is ſpoken of the Spirit waſhing away the filth of ſin like water. To prove the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall preſence of Chriſts body in the Lords Supper, they quote, <hi>This is my body,</hi> overthrowing the nature of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, taking the figne quite away, and deſtroying the nature of Chriſts body by making it to be in many places at once. So that there is neither Sacrament, nor Chriſts body. To eſtabliſh their feigned Purgatory, they interpret 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.13. of naturall fire, which is ſpoken of the tryall of mens works by the judgement of Chriſt at the laſt day, when all mens works ſhall be revealed, as gold is tryed by paſſing the fire, and when their Purgatory will be at an end, as themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe. To eſtabliſh prayer to Saints, they urge the cuſtome of Kings Courts, wherein men come to Kings by Nobles, not conſidering that Kings are ignorant, and in danger, and ſoon wearied by many addreſſes, and therefore muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, protected, eaſed by them, that are about them; but God need not. Yea they drive men from reading Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, becauſe of theſe metaphors taken from humane af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, which God put in of purpoſe to draw men to it. So Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> in <hi>Latimers</hi> life, mentions a Priour in <hi>Cambridge</hi> that diſſwaded men from reading the Scriptures, leſt reading
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:118645:157"/>
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.26. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6. Plow-men looking back, and Bakers leavening the bread too little ſhould deſpair. To which <hi>Latimer</hi> anſwers, If a painter ſhould picture a Fox in a Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, in a Fryers coul, no Clown that ſhould ſee it, would imagine, that the Painter thought a Fox could preach, but intended to ſignifie Fryers did preach like Foxes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us labour to apply Metaphors aright, and then we ſhall profit by them. When we read <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. ſee what ſap we receive from Chriſt the ſpirituall vine, and whether we be his ſheep. And ſo in other parables.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Doct.</hi> The ſame thing is ſet out by divers ſimilitudes in Scripture. As the progreſſe of the Goſpel, Matth. 13. Our union with Chriſt by a Vine, Joh. 15. a Graffe, Rom. 11. a Body, 1 Cor. 12.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe variety is very pleaſing. Many different ſtrings make good muſick.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is very profitable. A fiſher had need of many baits. If one take not, another may.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Man hath many affections, and ſome outward objects work more upon love and joy, others upon ſorrow and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, others upon fear, others upon confidence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> In every thing that concerns thy ſoul, make uſe of ſuch ſimilitudes in Scripture as may moſt affect thee. As of the love of Mothers, when thou doubteſt of Gods favour. The ſtore of ſap the vine gives to the branches, may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thee, when thou feeleſt little grace in thee, and art grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for it. And ſo mayſt thou make uſe of other ſimilitudes, according to thy need.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Doct.</hi> Wicked wayes are crooked wayes. <hi>Such as turn aſide to their crooked wayes,</hi> Pſal. 125.5. <hi>They have made them croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked wayes,</hi> Iſa. 53.8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe they differ from the rule of Gods Word, which is a moſt ſtraight rule for all mens actions, and from which men ought not to bow neither to the right hand, nor to the left.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Mens own affections bow their wayes and make them crooked. No wit of man can decypher the innumerable crooked paths, to which mens crooked affections lead them.</p>
                  <pb n="306" facs="tcp:118645:158"/>
                  <p n="3">3. Mens mindes are bowed by earthly things, and then their wayes muſt needs be crooked. Therefore the Apoſtle bids us, <hi>Set our affections on things above, and not on things on the earth,</hi> Col. 3.2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Let us loath wicked wayes becauſe they are croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. Many men go aſide like the Sea-crab. As the Wagoner ſeeks by-wayes to avoyd hillocks, leſt he overturn his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon: ſo wicked men ſeek perverſe ways to avoyd dangers. Yet ſuch are ſelf-condemned, for every man would have a ſtraight way, that he may the ſooner be at his journeys end. We like not crooked arrows, meaſures, bodies. The woman bound by Satan was bowed together till Chriſt made her ſtraight. Luk. 13, 11, 13. Satan hath made many crooked in their wayes. How juſtly may God ſay to ſuch as the Crab in the Fable did to the Serpent, when he had given him his deaths wound for his crooked conditions, and then ſaw him ſtretch himſelf out ſtraight, <hi>At oportuit, ſic vixiſſe: It is too late now, you ſhould have lived ſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us take heed of apoſtaſie, and back-ſliding, for then we are ſure to walk in crooked wayes. Such <hi>are all gone aſide, they are altogether become filthy,</hi> Pſal. 14.3. <hi>They are turned aſide like a deceitfull bow,</hi> Pſal. 78.57. Some there are that go back from the good things which they have practiſed. They have heard the Word, now they are proud; and above ordinances. They have prayed in their families, now they follow the world. They have been ſober, now they haunt Taverns. They have been juſt, now they have learned to cheat and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. Others go from their former profeſſion, and turn Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, and Separatiſts from Gods people, forſaking Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, that were formerly dear unto them. Others go from their promiſes, from their vow in Baptiſme, and cleave to the world, and Satan; their Nationall covenant, promiſing reformation of themſelves and their families, they are yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reformed. Others go back from the duties they owe to God, as the duties of piety, ſobriety, juſtice, which had they never practiſed, profeſſed, nor promiſed, yet are they due to God by their Creation, &amp; neither mans Fall, nor Redemption can free them from them; nay, Heaven will not to eternity. Let groſſe wicked perſons then (drunkards, adulterers, ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:118645:158"/>
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) view their ugly condition. If we ſhould ſay, they were turned Papiſts, Jews, Turks, Heathen, they would be angry; Apoſtata's and backſliders are as bad, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they caſt not off the vail of Religion. They will continue in their crooked wayes, unleſſe God deliver them miraculouſly. <hi>Thou haſt ſtricken them, but they have not grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; thou haſt conſumed them, but they have refuſed to receive correction; they have made their faces harder then a rock, they have refuſed to return,</hi> Jerem. 5.3. <hi>Evill men, and ſeducets ſhall wax worſe and worſe, deceiving and being deceived,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.13. Cuſtome in ſin hardens them. How hard a thing it is for men to do good, that are accuſtomed to do evill, ſee Jerem. 13.23. No words will alter them. Some <hi>take Gods covenant in their mouth, that hate inſtruction,</hi> Pſal. 50.16, 17. No blows will mend them. <hi>When they are ſtricken, they will revolt more and more,</hi> Iſa. 1.5. No kindneſſe will reduce them. God uſed all loving means to reclaim the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> but they refuſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, Hoſ. 11.4, 5. No marvell then that Gods Miniſters loſe many exhortations beſtowed on many of their people. It is not becauſe they exhort not aright, but becauſe the people are refractary, reſolving not to amend, though their courſes be damnable, and they like reſty Jades, go backward when they are ſpurred; precepts, examples do no good, Miniſters and friends are diſheartened from dealing with them, as fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them incurable. So men thruſt through the heart diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Phyſicians and Chirurgeons. Men had need have no ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety with backſliders, unleſſe nature or their vocation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it, and then alſo they had need beware of hurt by them, for they are deſperate.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Doct.</hi> Obſtinacy in ſin is a great height of wickedneſſe. So God accounts it. <hi>I knew that thou art obſtinate, and thy neck is an iron ſinew, and thy brow braſſe,</hi> Iſa. 48.4. So he puniſheth it. <hi>If ye will not for all this hearken unto me, then I will puniſh you ſeaven times more for your ſins,</hi> Lev. 26.18.</p>

By a ſtrange woman here is meant the adultereſſe, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another mans Wife, God hath forbidden thee to touch or uſe as a Wife, and in that kinde ſhould be a ſtranger to thee. So a ſtrange God, Pſal. 81.9. is one whom we ought
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:118645:159"/>not to worſhip. Strange fire was ſuch as ought not to be uſed in Sacrifices, Lev. 19.1. So men may dwell in a City, and yet be ſtrangers for trade, if they be not Free men.</p>

                     <hi>Even from the ſtranger.</hi> This is another word in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and often ſignifies a woman of another Nation. For commonly ſtrumpets were odious, and it is likely that few <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> women would be ſuch, being ſo branded. <hi>There ſhall be no whore of the daughters of Iſrael,</hi> Deut. 23.17. It may be ſtrangers took the more liberty to be naught there, becauſe <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> women durſt not. And if any of <hi>Iſrael</hi> lived ſo lewdly, they were eſteemed as <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and that was a good argument to move young men to avoyd them. Some bring in unmarried women that ſet up naughty houſes for gain. But that is contrary to <hi>v.</hi> 17. which ſpeaks plainly of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried women.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Which flattereth with her words,</hi> Heb. <hi>which maketh her words ſmooth.</hi> Like butter and oyl, which will eaſily goe downe, Pſal. 55.21.</p>
                  <p>The ſumme is:</p>
                  <p>Heavenly wiſdome, if thou embrace it, will give thee knowledge and ſtrength, not onely to ſee and avoyd the ſnares of evill men, but alſo to keep thee out of, or bring thee out of the nets of wicked women, which are no leſſe dangerous to young men unexperienced, and prone to luſt, through the corruption of nature. Yea, and the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, becauſe women are more skilfull in ſugared words and have drawn away the wiſeſt and ſtrongeſt men, as <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>Samſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Figures none, unleſſe a Metaphor in the word <hi>Making ſmooth.</hi> As in ſmooth paths men ſtick not, but go on cheerfully, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any rub or let, ſo ſtrumpets ſtudy to compoſe their words, that the young man that hath beauty to ſatisfie their luſt, may ſtand at nothing, but readily hearken to their <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens</hi> Songs.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Doct.</hi> There is a medicine in Scripture for every diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe of the ſoul. Before there was a preſcript againſt the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome of evill men, now, an Antidote againſt the poyſon of evill women. <hi>The weapens of our warfare are not carnall, but mighty through God to the pulling down of ſtrong holds, caſting down
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:118645:160"/>imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth it ſelf againſt the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.4, 5. <hi>The Word of God is quick and powerfull, and ſharper then any two edged ſword, piercing even to the dividing aſunder of ſoul and ſpirit, and of the joynts and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and is a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart,</hi> Heb. 4.12.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe the Scripture is Gods Word, who is the catholick Phyſician of the ſoul. Phyſicians keep preſcripts for the cure of all diſeaſes in a book. Apothecaries have me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines in their ſhops for all maladies. The Scripture is Gods book and ſhop. It is Gods Armoury, in which are ſpirituall ſhields, ſwords, and all manner of weapons to deal with all manner of enemies. See the whole armour of God deſcribed, Eph. 6.13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. An induction of particulars will prove it. See a ſhield againſt the three great Idols of the world. <hi>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world, and the world paſſeth away, and the luſt thereof,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.15, 16, 17. Againſt pride in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. <hi>God reſiſteth the proud,</hi> Jam. 4.6. And they cannot eſcape whom God will ruine. Againſt covetouſneſſe. More is loſt then gotten, if a man could get all the world, which never any one yet did. <hi>For, what is a man profited, if he ſhall gain the whole world, and loſe his owne ſoul? Or, what ſhall a man give in exchange for his ſoul?</hi> Mat. 16.26. Againſt voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. See the rich man in hell, Luk. 16.23. All his wealth could not keep him out.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is a fence againſt ſeverall degrees of ſin. Againſt evill thoughts. <hi>Mens thoughts will accuſe one another in the day when God ſhall judge the ſecrets of men,</hi> Rom. 2.15, 16. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt evill words. <hi>Every idle word that men ſhall ſpeak, they ſhall give account thereof in the day of Judgement. For by thy words thou ſhalt be condemned,</hi> Matth. 12.36, 37. Againſt evil deeds. This <hi>Joſeph</hi> knew, ſaying, <hi>How can I do this great wickedneſſe and ſin againſt God?</hi> Gen. 39.9.</p>
                  <pb n="311" facs="tcp:118645:160"/>
                  <p n="4">4. There are many remedies for the ſame ſin. As, prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions, examples of good men avoyding it, threatnings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, and judgements upon ſuch as do it. As, againſt Blaſphemy. It is forbidden in the third Commandement, <hi>Thou ſhalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain.</hi> It was avoyded by <hi>Job.</hi> When his Wife bids him, <hi>Curſe God and die: Job ſaid unto her, Thou ſpeakeſt as one of the fooliſh women ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,</hi> Job 2.9, 10. It was threatned and puniſhed. <hi>He that blaſphemeth the Name of the Lord, he ſhall ſurely be put to death.</hi> And ſo was the Blaſphemer, Lev. 24.16, 23. Sabbath brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king is forbidden in the fourth Commandement. <hi>In it thou ſhalt do no manner of work, &amp;c.</hi> It is avoyded or prevented by <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s care, Neh. 13.15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He forbids it, and threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens puniſhment. The like is, Ezek. 20.13. <hi>My Sabbaths they greatly polluted; then I ſaid, I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderneſſe to conſume them.</hi> It was puniſhed by the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Captivity. <hi>

Threatned. <hi>Whoſo ſheddeth mans blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed,</hi> Gen. 9.6. Puniſhed in <hi>Joab,</hi> 1 King. 2.31, 34. Adultery is forbidden in the ſeventh Commandement. <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit adultery.</hi> Avoyded by <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Gen. 39.9.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Let us obſerve our diſpoſitions, and tentations, to ſeek for prevention or fit cure. Elſe the medicine may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for the ſore, and do no good.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Obſerve thoſe places of Scripture that make againſt thoſe ſins to which thou art moſt enclined or tempted. So men in Gardens and Apothecaries ſhops pick out what will cure their diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Keep them in thy minde, as men do medicines for their owne infirmities in their houſes, to be ready in time of need. A man may die that hath his medicine to ſeek.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. Apply them when corruption or temptation works; as Chriſt did, Mat. 4. who had a place of Scripture ready to repell every temptation of Satan.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Doct.</hi> As we are in danger of evill men, ſo likewiſe of evill women. So was <hi>Joſeph</hi> in danger of his Miſtris, Gen. 39.7. And the young man in danger of the Harlot, Prov. 7.7, 10.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> If you ſee light and wanton carriage in women, come not in their company. Hurt ye may get much, good ye can expect none. Either ſin or a priſon may follow, as in <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s caſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Doct.</hi> It is good for men to know all things dangerous for their ſouls. Therefore many fins are reckoned up, as Idolatry, adultery, cruelty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ezek. 18.11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, lying, killing, ſtealing. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hoſ. 4.2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. A man can never be ſafe elſe. If one ſeen ſin be eſcaped, another unſeen will lay hold on him.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Doct.</hi> The danger from evill women is great. <hi>By means of an whoriſh woman a man is brought to a piece of bread; and the adultereſſe will hunt for the precious life,</hi> ch. 6.26. <hi>Dalilah</hi> deprives <hi>Samſon</hi> of the eyes of his body, Judg. 16.19, 21. Strange women deprived <hi>Solomon</hi> of the eyes of his minde, 1 King. 11.1, 4.</p>

                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe as good women are modeſt, ſo Whores are unſatiable in filthineſſe. Witneſſe the ſtews in other Countreys, where men goe in all the day long to one woman.</p>
                  <pb n="313" facs="tcp:118645:161"/>
                  <p n="2">2. As good women are moſt tenderly affected, ſo are wicked ones moſt cruell. It is obſerved, that where-women are in company, murder follows robbery.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Come not neer women noted for wickedneſſe. Be wiſe, and ſee danger in their faces, and eſcape it. Fooliſh men fear no danger in adultery, till they feel it. It is a troden path, and therefore they think it ſafe. Why then ſhould the Wiſe-man tell us, that God gives us wiſdome to keep us from the evill woman, if there were no danger? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve God, and eſcape the evill woman.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Doct.</hi> There is a propriety of Husbands and Wives one to another, which no power on earth may violate.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Infringe not this propriety. Remember that all but thine owne Husband and Wife are ſtrangers to thee. To this end,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Refrain thy looks from thy neighbors wife. Adultery begins at the eyes. It creeps into the heart at thoſe windows.

Now we know, the head guides the body. Some underſtand it of God, who is called <hi>the guide of Judah's youth,</hi> Jer. 3.4. And ſo they draw the words to Idolatry, which rather ſet out adultery, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the words before and after the text.

                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe God inſtituted marriage.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe God is a witneſſe of the mutuall promiſe of fidelity which is made in marriage, and takes eſpecial notice of the breach of it, to puniſh it, although the husband know it not. <hi>The Lord hath been witneſſe between thee, and the wife of thy youth, againſt whom thou haſt dealt treacherouſly; yet is ſhe thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant,</hi> Mal. 2.14. The ſin of the adultereſſe is aggravated by every word. She not onely fails in her duty to her Husband, but forſakes him, and deals falſly with him. She forſakes her guide that took care of her, and that in her youth, when ſhe had moſt need of a guide. She quite forgets not onely a promiſe but a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nans, and that ſolemnly made, not onely in the ſight of men, but of the great God, the inſtituter of marriage, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the contract, whereby ſhe bound her ſelf to cleave to him onely ſo long as they lived together, the judge and the avenger of the breach. But now without regard of the love and benefit paſt, or of the ſtrong binding covenant of God ſhe breaks thus ſhamefully out, not onely to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering of her own ſoul, but of them alſo that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured by her. The young man alſo is here by ſtrong reaſons moved to take heed of her; for though ſhe might flatter him, and profeſſe much love to him, yet queſtionleſſe ſhe that had been falſe to her Husband, her firſt Love, and durſt violate the covenant of her God, would never be true to him, but make uſe of him, till ſhe had waſted his body and eſtate, and then leave him.</p>

Wantonneſſe takes men away from among the living, and brings them to the dead in body and ſoul, which have dyed before them, either by a naturall death, or by ſuch like wanton courſes as theſe men take. <hi>Death</hi> and the <hi>dead</hi> here muſt include both ſpirituall and temporall death, the grave, and hell. For it ſeems not a ſufficient reaſon to keep men from adultery, and from Harlots houſes, that they muſt die, for this is common to all men. A man may ſay, as mockers do, Let us commit adultery without any fear, for nothing ſhall befall us which doth not befall the chaſteſt men. They muſt die as well as we.

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Doct.</hi> The Scripture gives many encouragements to men to walk in good wayes. As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Precepts. All the ten Commandements, the moſt exact rule of a godly life, that ever was.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Exhortations. <hi>I beſeech you therefore Brethren, by the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God,</hi> Rom. 12.1. Who would not be perſwaded, when God himſelf exhorts by his Miniſters, that might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Examples of the excellenteſt men that ever lived on the face of the earth. See ſtore of them recorded and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, who lived before Chriſts incarnation, Heb. 11. Apoſtles afterwards. Yea, Chriſt himſelf the example of examples. <hi>Be ye followers of me, as I alſo am of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.1.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Rich promiſes. <hi>If ye be willing and obedient, ye ſhall eat the good of the Land,</hi> Iſa. 1.19. <hi>Bleſſed are the meek, for they ſhall inherit the earth,</hi> Mar. 5.5.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Goſpel, which ſhews us a ſecond and greater ground of of godly life, then the Law or Creation did. <hi>The grace of God, that bringeth ſalvatien hath appeared to all
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:118645:177"/>men, teaching us, that denying ungodlineſſe, &amp;c.</hi> Titus 2.11, 12.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It ſets out the help of the Spirit. Some <hi>walk after the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>are led by the Spirit,</hi> Rom 8.1, 14. Without this help we might utterly deſpair of walking in good wayes. We could no more do it, then a man could chooſe, or walk in a fair way in the world, that had not a ſoul or ſpirit in him to direct him.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Gods acceptation is there ſet out. Our beſt actions are ſinfull. God likes not ſuch. And if they may not be accepted, who would loſe his labour to do them? <hi>Cornelius his prayers and almeſ-deeds, were come up for a memoriall before God,</hi> Act. 10.4.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Gods commendation. This is more then acceptation. When a Father proclaims to others what a good Son he hath, it ſhews abundance of love in him, and encourages the childe to pleaſe him. So God doth animate us, <hi>I know thy works,</hi> Rev. 2.2, 9, 13, 19.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Gods preſervation of us in good wayes, when our hearts are ſet upon them, and we are ignorantly in danger. So he kept <hi>Abimelech</hi> from touching <hi>Sarah,</hi> Gen. 20.6.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> It ſhould encourage Chriſtians to be more carefull of their wayes then all the world beſides. We ſhould be brighter then others, as the ſtars are brighter then the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament. Heathen have few encouragements in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of us. Turks have not much more. Jews want the New Teſtament. Papiſts may not read the Scriptures. We have all encouragements to good wayes. Let us therefore ſay with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>I will run the way of thy commandements, when thou ſhalt enlarge my heart,</hi> Pſal. 119.32.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Doct.</hi> When wicked men are cut off, God ſometimes ſpares the good. The truth will appear, if you compare this <hi>v.</hi> with the next. And alſo in <hi>Noah</hi>'s deliverance from the Flood, and <hi>Lot</hi>'s in <hi>Sodom. When the wicked are cut off, thou ſhall ſee it,</hi> Pſal. 37.34.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. To ſhew Gods ſpecial care and providence over them. <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s parti-coloured coat, and <hi>Benjamin</hi>'s large meſſe, were ſignes of ſpeciall love.</p>
                  <pb n="345" facs="tcp:118645:177"/>
                  <p n="2">2. To draw men to piety. We are in part carnall. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> hath <hi>Canaan</hi> and a numerous poſterity promiſed him, to encourage him in piety.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. If we be preſerved when others periſh, let us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Gods favour to be the cauſe of it. We had ſins as well as they, and deſerved to be cut off as well as they.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us be encouraged to piety. If there be any way in the world to eſcape judgements, this is it. Landlords do not uſe to turn their tenants out of dores, while they keep co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants. Good men are ſaid to inherit the earth, bad men onely to poſſeſſe it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Doct.</hi> Uprightneſſe is expected of thoſe that expect Gods bleſſing. <hi>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace,</hi> Pſal. 37.37. <hi>Light is ſown for the righteous, and joy for the upright in heart,</hi> Pſal. 97.11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe God hates hypocrifie. It is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the God of truth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He hates evill ends.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He hates ſelf-ends in men, who ſhould all ſerve his ends.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He hates by-ends, when men aim at any thing that tends not to his glory.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p n="9">9. He that doth all good from the heart.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Doct.</hi> Perfection is expected of them that look for Gods bleſſing. <hi>Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father, which is in heaven is perfect,</hi> Mat. 5.48. <hi>I will behave my ſelf wiſely in a perfect way, O when wilt thou come unso me?

                  <p n="1">1. Perfection of ſincerity. This was proved in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer point. A fincere man is a perfect man. An hypocrite is but a picture of a man.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Perfection of parts. Every ſaving grace muſt be had and uſed. So a childe is a perfect man. A defective monſter is not.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Perfection of integrity. When our obedience is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall to all Gods commandements.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Perfection of degrees. That is required intentionally, and ſhall be given us actually, before we come to heaven. So a childe is not a perfect man, till he come to his full growth.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Doct.</hi> God often gives good men a comfortable and quiet continuance in their habitations. As to <hi>David,</hi> after his troubles from <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Abſolon.</hi> To <hi>Solomon,</hi> for a long time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. That they may have the more time to ſerve God, and do good. A breathing time, that <hi>the Churchet having reſt, may be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. That they may have the more encouragement to do it. Mens ſpirits are down in trouble, and have enough to doe to ſuffer patiently. They are freer for action in quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Where God looks for ſuffering, he puts not to action.</p>

                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. That men may ſee that there is a God. While they ſee no difference between good and bad men, they think there is no over-ruling God. The Heathen man confeſſes it. <hi>Sollicitor nullos eſſe putare Deos: I am ſollicited to think there is no God. Ovid.</hi> In a Common-wealth, or in an Army, where no difference is made between good and bad people and ſouldiers, men think there is no Magiſtrate or Generall there. So in the Church. But when God puts a difference, they cry out, <hi>Verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth,</hi> Pſal. 58.11.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That men might ſee by this fore-running provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, a pattern and proof of the generall judgement to come.</p>

He might deſtroy us like wicked men. <hi>Are there not with you, even with you, ſins againſt the Lord your God?</hi> 2 Chr. 28.10. See Gods diſtinguiſhing mercy in it, and proclaim it.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. They have objects of ſin in the world in abundance, in all places, to feed their eyes, ears, and all their ſenſes. A fountain will run, if it find a river. Fire will burn, if it meet with fuel.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God hath not healed wicked men by his ſanctifying Spirit: Bad humours will work in mens bodies, till they be purged away. And the more purged away, the leſſe they work.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. God is pleaſed ſometimes not to reſtrain wicked men, but to let them run on to their own perdition, and the hurt of many others. So an unruly horſe with the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle out of his mouth runs furiouſly, till he overthrow himſelf, and his rider.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Let us be provoked to be reſtleſſe in good.

                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Drunkenneſſe breeds dropſies, gluttony breeds feavers, wantonneſſe foul diſeaſes, all murderers, and ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten mens lives, as the floud drowned many young men in the world.

                  <p n="2">2. Trouble of conſcience ſometimes ends their dayes. Sin of betraying his Maſter made <hi>Judas</hi> hang himſelf. <hi>Spira</hi> would have killed himſelf, and did waſte his body to death for his Apoſtaſie.

The common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are like boyes, who when they ſee knaves upon the ſtage, gorgeouſly apparelled, and acting Kings, think them happy, and could wiſh to be like them; but they conſider not the poverty and miſery that may befall them, when they are ſtript of their gay clothes. So the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people are bewitcht with the riches of ſinners, not confidering they may die, or loſe all before their age.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Grudge not at their proſperity. They may die ſooner then meaner men. <hi>Every plant</hi> (ſaith our bleſſed Saviour) <hi>which my heavenly Father hath not planted, ſhall be rooted up,</hi> Mat. 15.13. Who would be a flouriſhing tree, to be roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out? or an oxe fatted, to be killed? <hi>A brutiſh man knows not, neither doth a fool underſtand this. When the wicked ſpring as the graſſe, and when all the workers of iniquity do flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; it is that they ſhall be deſtroyed for ever,</hi> Pſal. 92.7. They ſhall be cut off certainly, ſuddenly, utterly. <hi>Tum ferè auferuntur à terra, cum maximè velint vivere. Then are they for the moſt part taken away from the earth, when they are moſt deſirous to live in it. Baine.</hi> When they have feathered their neſt, and reckon upon long life, as the fool in the Goſpel, Luk. 12. God will deſtroy them, when they leaſt look for it. Therefore, <hi>Fret not thy ſelf, becauſe of evill

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Doct.</hi> Tranſgreſſors deal treacherouſly with God. <hi>The treacherous dealer dealeth treacherouſly,</hi> Iſa. 21.2. <hi>The treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous dealers have dealt treacherouſly; yea, the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherouſly,</hi> Iſa. 24.16. <hi>They are all adulterers, and an aſſembly of treacherous men,</hi> Jer. 9.2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe they fail in the truſt committed to them, as a Servant or Steward deceiving his Maſter is trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous. So was he that had received one talent, though he had not ſpent it, becauſe he did not improve it. <hi>Thou wicked and ſlothfull ſervant, &amp;c.</hi> Mat. 25.26.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe they act againſt their truſt, which is an higher degree of treachery. As if a Servant or Steward ſhould riſe up againſt his Maſter, in ſtead of obedience. So <hi>Judas</hi> is called <hi>the traitor,</hi> Luk. 6.16.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe they betray Gods honour, as much as in them lies. An Embaſſador is treacherous, that diſhonors his Prince in ſtead of honoring him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe they labour to undoe Gods Church. Is not a ſervant treacherous, that ſhould go about to poyſon all the family? So are wicked men, endevouring to ruine the Church by bad counſel and example.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Sin goes by imitation. If children of godly parents will imitate other men in evill, rather then their parents in good, no wonder if children of ungodly parents be evill like their parents, and periſh with them. We read not of one good among all the Kings of the ten Tribes. All were idolatrous, like their predeceſſors.</p>

And no wonder if God hate finfull courſes, as being contrary both to his nature and will. Let us therefore ſhew our love to God, in hating what he hates. <hi>Ye that love the Lord, hate evill,</hi> Pſal. 97.10.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Doct.</hi> If men will not for their owne ſakes forſake ſin, they ſhould do it for their childrens ſake.

Therefore they muſt take heed they bring not evill on their children by diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> brings deſtruction on <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> after his death, though he repented in his life. <hi>Surely at the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the Lord came this upon Judah, to remove them out of his ſight for the ſins of Manaſſeh, according to all that he did,</hi> 2 King. 24.3. And <hi>Ahab</hi> brought Gods judgement on his poſterity, though he humbled himſelf. <hi>Seeſt thou how Ahab humbleth himſelf before me? Becauſe he humbleth himſelf before me, I will not bring the evill in his dayes, but in his Sons dayes will I bring the evill upon his houſe,</hi> 1 King. 21.29.</p>

                  <p>THe order of <hi>Solomon</hi> is to be obſerved; he had formerly exhorted the young man to ſeek after Wiſdome, and ſhewed him what evils it would preſerve him from; now he gives him ſome directions how to practiſe what he ſhould be taught, and ſhews what good he ſhould get by it: He had diſſwaded him from cruelty in the firſt Chapter, and from adultery in the ſecond; now he perſwades him to piety and equity in this Chapter: and leſt the keeping of ſo many precepts impoſed upon the young man, ſhould trouble him, he promiſeth in general, and afterwards interlaceth in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, divers promiſes of good and ſure rewards, to allure him to audience and obedience. <hi>Solomon</hi> had a floud, or a wood of words, a <hi>Sylva Synonymorum,</hi> and therefore urges the ſame things with elegant variation of phraſe, as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther often inculcats the ſame things daily in other words to affect his child the more, that ſo, what works not upon him at firſt, may at laſt. The two firſt verſes are a general preface to the reſt of the Chapter, wherein is, 1. an exhortation in the firſt verſe: 2 ly. a promiſe to ſet it on, Verſe 2.</p>
                  <p>For the words, <hi>My Son,</hi> ſee on <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.18. He often uſeth the amiable name of a Son; intimating, that he ſpeaks not as an Enemy, nor a Neighbour, or Friend, or Maſter, or King, but as a loving Father to his beloved child: And wel might he call the hearer or reader his Son, on whom he had beſtowed ſo many godly inſtructions, and whom he goes on to inſtruct ſtil, like a Father.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Forget not.</hi> See on <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.17. Let my law ſtick faſt in thy memory; whatſoever thou forget, either children, buſineſſe, or whatever els is deer unto thee, be ſure thou forget not my Law: ſooner forget muſick and ſinging, as the godly Jews would rather forget them, then <hi>Jeruſalem.

                  <p>THe Exhortation was in the former Verſe. The promiſe to encourage us to obedience is in this. That men might with more courage endeavour to obey <hi>Solomons</hi> wiſe directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, God joynes the reward to the work, and promiſes thoſe things, which all men, but eſpecially young men moſt of all deſire, and long for, and are moſt dear to men of tender years, to wit, a long, quiet, and happy life. Some diſtinguiſh the three things promiſed thus, That by length of daies ſhould be meant a life on earth as long as may be drawn out by any ſtrength of nature. By long life, or years, of life eternall life in another world. By peace, peace of conſcience. But they may rather be underſtood thus, By length of daies may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood a life that laſts long. By long life, or years of life an healthfull life.

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Doct.</hi> God might have required full obedience without rewards, yet he promiſeth large ones. That he might require it without reward, appears in the preface of the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Obey, for <hi>I am Jehovah,</hi> that gave thee thy being, <hi>Thy God,</hi> in covenant with thee, <hi>That brought thee out of the Land of</hi> Aegypt. A great benefit. <hi>Out of the houſe of bondage.</hi> A great deliverance. That he will give full rewards, appears in the end of the ſecond, and fifth Commandements. Forſake Idolatry, and worſhip me aright; For <hi>I ſhew mercy to thouſands of them, that love me and keep my Commandements. Honor thy Father, and thy Mother, that thy daies may be long in the land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</hi> So he promiſes <hi>Abraham</hi> to be <hi>his ſhield, and exceeding great reward.</hi> Gen. 15.1. For the firſt part, That God may require obedience without any reward, appears</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe hee is not any way indebted to us for our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. He hath all of himſelf, and nothing from us. Nor gets no addition of happineſſe by our obedience.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We are indebted to him for all the good things we have, as Life, Health, Food, Goods, World Heaven; we have all from him, and that of free grace. And it is ſtrange for a debtor to require mony of his creditor; wee cannot then merit any thing from him, that cannot adde any thing to him; neither doth he need any thing. Hee that merits of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, muſt ſome way ſupply his wants. Sacrifices could not do it. And if they could do it, he need not take them of us that owes all the cattell of the World. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if God did need, how ſhould we ſupply his wants, that cannot ſupply our own for ſoul or body? He that cannot keep his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, cannot relieve others.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe God is abſolute Lord over all, and may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand what hee liſt without rewarding any creature in Heaven or in Earth. For the ſecond, that yet he will give a full reward, appears.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe he is mercifull, and ſtands upon his honor. And where juſtice will give no reward, mercy will. So Fathers
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:118645:188"/>promiſe many things to their children, to encourage them to do their dutie: Here is long, and healthful years, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie; and what needs a man more in this life?</p>
                  <p n="2">2ly. Becauſe God is faithful, and hath promiſed a full reward to every good action, ſo that mercy and truth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in it, though juſtice require it not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. To acknowledge, that if God bleſſe us in ſoul or bodie, it is of his free grace, not of the merit of our obedience. He might by his right over us, require ſervice without pay: yet he is ſo merciful, that he wil not. So a father may look for duty freely from a child, yet he provides for him, and gives him an inheritance,</p>
                  <p n="2">2ly. Let this encourage us to dutie: we owe it to God, therefore doe it; we ſhal have a ful reward, therefore do it cheerfully: this is a double band, kindneſſe uſeth to work more upon mens ſpirits, then dutie; ſo let it do with us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God.

                  <p n="2">2. It teaches us not to complain for the troubles of old age, but to bleſſe God for the comforts we have ſeen, more then others in the length of our daies.

                  <p>For the words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let not mercy and truth.</hi> Theſe two are oft enjoyned together in Scripture: and it is pitty, that they being ſo nearly joyned in themſelves ſhould ever be ſeparated. Sometimes they are
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:118645:190"/>jointly attributed to God. <hi>His mercy is everlaſting, and his truth endureth to all generations.</hi> Pſal. 100.5. <hi>His merciful kindneſs is great towards us, and the truth of the Lord eudureth for ever.</hi> 117.2. Sometimes to man. <hi>Mercy and truth preſerve the King.</hi> Chap. 20.28. When they are attributed to God, then Gods mercy is ſhewed in promiſing or giving man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good, that deſerves nothing but ill of him. His truh is ſhewed in performance of his promiſes: When they are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of man, then is mercy ſeen in giving freely to the poor, who deſerve nothing of us, yea to enemies, who deſerve ill of us. Truth is manifeſted in doing what we owe by promiſe, or debt to men. <hi>Miſericordia eſt gratia, qua ex noſtro libero animo benefacimus alteri, non ex debito, non ex paſſione. Veritas, quâ ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſa omni fictione adaequamus facta dictis, verba cordi, corde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitis: Gratia, qua gratuita, veritas, qua debita exhibemus. Caje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etan. Mercy is favour, whereby out of our own free mind we doe good to another man, not out of debt, not out of paſſion. Truth is that vertue, whereby ſhutting out all feigning, we do equall our deeds to our words, our words to our haart, our heart to our debts. Grace</hi> (or mercy) <hi>is, whereby we give free things; Truth, whereby we pay</hi> (or reſtore) <hi>things due</hi> to others. Some inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the Text here of Gods mercy and truth, and that two waies.</p>

For though a man may ſo carry himſelf, that God will not deal mercifully with him; yet he cannot carry himſelf ſo badly, that God will not deal truly with him, for that were a blemiſh to God. If he be upright, God will perform his promiſes to him: if not, God will execute his threatnings upon him: whichſoever God doth, he ſhewes forth his truth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By way of promiſe, not of exhortation. And they read it, <hi>Mercy and truth ſhall not forſake thee.</hi> And they tie it to the former words, if thou forget not my Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then God wil deal mercifully with thee, and perform all his promiſes to thee.

                  <p>
                     <hi>About thy neck.</hi> See on <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. Hereby is meant.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To have them faſt, ſo that they may not be loſt; as men tie their Jewels about their necks.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To have them ready to uſe, when occaſion is offered, as a jewell about the neck, that hath vertue in it, is at hand for uſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To keep ſome externall memorialls to put us in mind of theſe vertues upon the beholding of them, as jewells on the neck, may put us in mind of buſineſſes, being ever in fight.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To delight in them, as men doe in jewells which they hang about their necks.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. To count it an ornament to us to deale mercifully, and truly with others. The children of Nobles, when they were little, were wont to wear ſome jewell about their neck, that they might be known to be of high birth. So ſhould wee make our heavenly parentage known by works of mercy, and truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And write them upon the Table of thine heart.</hi> Have them in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:118645:192"/>all remembrance, as things not written in Tables of ſtone, as <hi>Moſes</hi> Law was, but in thy heart, as in a Table of perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all memory, as Gods Law was written at firſt in <hi>Adams</hi> heart, and as we write in our Tablebooks thoſe things, of which wee would keep a preciſe memorandum. They ſhould be moſt dear unto us. So Queen <hi>Mary</hi> ſaid, <hi>They that ſhould rip her, ſhould find Callis at her heart.</hi> Some have the images of their deareſt friends in form of an heart, which they hang upon their breaſt the ſeat of the heart. So mercy and truth ſhould have ſo deep an impreſſion upon the underſtanding, that they never go out of the memory. Some underſtand by <hi>binding them about the neck,</hi> ſpeaking of them, and teaching them to others, for the throat is the inſtrument of ſpeaking. And by <hi>writing them on the Table of the heart</hi> th'inking of them, and remembring them. But the former interpretation is more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For heart.</hi> See on <hi>ver.</hi> 1. and on <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.2. Here is one thing ſet out by divers ſimilitudes in an eminent gradation like three ſteps of a ladder one above another. Mercy and truth are compared.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To companions, that muſt not depart from us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To a chain about the neck, which is nearer then a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To a thing written in a Tablebook, which is nearer to the book, then a chain, that hangs looſe about the neck.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Figures.</hi> A double metaphor, wherin keeping mercy and truth, or exerciſing them outwardly is compared to tying a gold chain about the neck for Ornament. And retaining them in the heart is compared to things written in a Tablebook, that they may not be forgotten.</p>

Duties to men are to be made conſcience of, as wel as duties to God: See the firſt enjoyned, the ſecond conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment, and the ſecond is like unto it, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelfe. Mat.</hi> 22.37, 38, 39. Though the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees did dutie to God, yet are they blamed for neglect of dutie to men. <hi>Wo unto you Scribes and Phariſees hypocrites, for ye devour widowes houſes, and for a pretence make long prayer; therefore ye ſhal receive the greater damnation. Mat.</hi> 23.14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe God hath a care of the preſervation of his Image; In all the world, no creature ſo like God, as man.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God made laws to that purpoſe, as good rulers make laws, not for their own honour only, but for their ſubjects peace and wealth alſo.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God appointed Magiſtrates to execute thoſe laws, to be <hi>custodes utriuſ<expan>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe.</hi> To condemn hypocrites, who profeſſe religion, but want humanity: of ſuch the beloved Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If a man ſay I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar. And this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment have we from him, that he who loveth God, love his brother alſo.</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.20.21.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. Mercy and Truth ſhould alwaies go together. <hi>If ye wil deal kindly and truly with my Master, tell me, Gen.</hi> 24.49. <hi>Lie not one to another. Put on bowels of mercies. Col.</hi> 3.9.12.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe both are ornaments to us: Men wear lace on good clothes, ſo doth mercy adorn truth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. both are profitable to others: ſometimes truth alone ties us to do good to other men, when we are by dutie or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:118645:193"/>engaged to them: but certainly mercy will ſupply o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wants, where no particular engagment is.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The want of the one, buries the commendation of the other; ſuch an one is a merciful man to the poor, but there is no truth in him, no man can build upon his word; ſuch a man is very juſt in all his dealings, but as hard as flint; he hath a good eſtate, but the poor fare never the better for it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Both are together in God, elſe could we look for no favour from him, nor expect the performance of any promiſe made by him for we daily give him cauſe to break them all.</p>

To blame ſuch as brag of one of theſe, but want the other; one brags of his charity to the poor, and thinks at his death he muſt needs go to heaven for it, though he got all his wealth by fraudulent dealing: Another boaſts of his juſt dealing, no man can ſay, black is his eye, though no poor man ever taſted of his cup: One is no ſign of ſalvation, when the other leads to hel. In Logick, <hi>Concluſio ſemper ſequitur partem debiliorem, The concluſion alwaies followes the weaker part.</hi> So here, hel claim her own.</p>

                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Be not content with one of theſe alone, make a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of them in your heart, and life: Thoſe whom God hath joyned together, let no man put aſſunder; then may you ſay with <hi>David, I wil ſing of mercy and judgment, unto thee O Lord wil I ſing.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. Good muſt be done to them to whom we owe nothing. This is to be a true neighbour in Chriſts judgment, and mens; <hi>Which now of theſe three thinkest thou</hi> ſaith our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to the <hi>Lawyer</hi>) <hi>was neighbour unto him that fel among the Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">1. For the creatures ſake, we are Gods creature, ſo are they, God would not have us neglect them, we ſhould not do it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For mans ſake, they are not beaſts, but men, as well as we; and while we are men, we may need others: no man can ſtand wholly on his own bottom.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For Gods ſake, who requires it, and to whom we can ſhew no other real requital, for he needs not us, nor ours, but

                  <p n="4">4. For pitties ſake, every facultie of the ſoul muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, elſe it is in vain placed there.</p>

<pb n="396" facs="tcp:118645:197"/>not onely relying on God, but waiting with aſſurance of a good event, eſpecially if we wait upon the right perſon, and that upon good grounds. Some writers make a coherence here. Some of them tie it to the firſt verſe, as if it had reſpect to the keeping of the Law, thus, Do not be affraid, that by reaſon of thy weakneſſe thou canſt not keep Gods command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; neither think on the other ſide, that thou canſt know them by thy naturall wit, or do them by thy natural ſtrength: but truſt in the commander, and hee will make thee able in ſome good meaſure to do what he enjoines: others knit theſe words to the third Verſe. Becauſe thou art not able to keep mercy and truth, truſt in God, and he will make thee able: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers tie it to the fourth verſe.

But it is better to take the words without any coherence according to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer interpretation.

Among the firſt precepts of wiſdome, humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie is commended, and confidence in God, whom to have alwaies before our eyes, and to call for his help is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt wiſdome, as on the contrary, to lean to our own prudence is the greateſt folly. For <hi>what haſt thou that thou didſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. Let us uſe means, but place all our truſt in God, when all means in heaven and earth fail us, he wil ſupply us. If a man had a ſhip with ſailes, mariners, all proviſions need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, yet if the wind fail, he cannot go on in his voyage. If that ſerve, worſe tackling wil ſerve.

                  <p>COnfidence on God was required in the laſt Verſe, and that in the heart. Here homage to God is required, and acknowledgement of him in all our waies. And an encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging promiſe is added of better ſucceſſe, then we could other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe expect. God will direct our paths to a better end, then we look for. For the words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In all.</hi> See on <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.13. Not in ſome one way, but in all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thy waies.</hi> See on <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.15. Here is meant the actions of our life, in which we continue, and go on, as travailers in their way. It is ſeldom uſed for thoughts, which are internall, or words, but for deeds, or courſes of life in ſcripture phraſe; Yet is God to be acknowledged in them alſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Acknowledge him.</hi> See on <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.2. on the word, <hi>Know.</hi> For thoſe whom we will not acknowledge, wee make the world believe, we know them not. Some underſtand it of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging God in the beginning of our works, or in the contriving of them. To acknowledge him, as a Catholick en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyner, or director, and not to dare to goe about any thing not agreeable to his word, nor in any way diſagree able.</p>
                  <p>To take notice what God appoints to be done, and how, and to what end, and to proceed accordingly, and commit the ſucceſs to him, as a ſervant, or letter-carrier doth his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe appointed, not taking care whether it be likely to prove wel or ill. Others underſtand it of acknowleding God in the progreſſe of our works. And that either as a perpetual overſeer, which will keep us from evill, and encourage us to good. So God bids <hi>Abraham, walk before me, and be thou perfect.</hi> Gen. 17.1. Or as an enabler, without whom wee can do no good, nor get no good by what we doe, and therefore pray to him
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:118645:200"/>for ſtrength to do what we undertake, and a bleſſing upon it: others interpret it of the ſucceſſe of our workes, if it be good, then to acknowledge God the giver of it, or rewarder. If bad, then to acknowledge God the revenger, if we did ill, or trier of our graces, if wee did well, and ſpeed ill. Under theſe heads come the many interpretations of commenters. It is hard to ſay preciſely, which is intended. I conceive, Not the firſt, becauſe he ſpeaks not of the preparations for our journey, but of the journey it ſelf. Nor the laſt, for that is the end of the way, not the way it ſelf. Nor the firſt part of the ſecond in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation taking God as an overſeer. But the ſecond part of it, looking to him for all ſtrength, which is a greater acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of him, as it is more to enable one to doe the work, then to look on, while he doth it. Alſo it agrees well with what went before. Truſt in him onely, and no way to thy ſelf, and ſo acknowledge all ſtrength to be in him, and ſeek to him for it. It agrees well with what followes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And.</hi> That is, Then, when thou haſt ſo done, thou maieſt boldly expect a good iſſue from him of all thou doeſt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his will. So this particle is tranſlated, <hi>Then he is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious unto him.</hi> Iob 33.24.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He ſhall direst thy paths.</hi> For <hi>paths</hi> ſee on <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.19. on the word <hi>waies.</hi> Some underſtand this of informing men, what they may lawfully doe, and what not. But it is better inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted of relation to the end. He will make thy waies to proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and give a comfortable ſucceſſe: So that here is not a bare reward, but a ſuitable one. Acknowledge thou all thy ſtrength to come from God, and pray to him to aſſiſt thee, and he will bleſſe thy labours, that thou ſhalt effect more then thou couldſt expect.</p>

                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe there is a difference of mens conditions,
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:118645:204"/>elſe no need of ſearch: Some are in the broad way to hel, others in the narrow way to heaven.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We are all naturally in the worſt condition, and ſhould therefore take notice of it, and ſeek to get out of it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It may be doubtful whether we be out of it or no, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the likeneſſe between common and ſaving graces. There is in wicked men ſometimes, ſome kind of repentance, and faith. <hi>There is a way which ſeemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the waies of death. Chap.</hi> 14.12. Try which is right.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 It is a difficult thing to diſcern, for a wicked man may go far in outward performances, and forward profeſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. To tax all ſuch as have no mind to look into their ſpirituall condition; they are forward to caſt up their books to know their temporal eſtates, and upon every diſtemper to adviſe with the Phyſician, for their bodies, for fear of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe breeding in them; only the poor ſoul is neglected: we fear ſuch as eat and drink any thing, and have no regard of diet, that they wil be ſick; and ſuch as love not to look into their debt-bookes, that they wil be bankrupts: So we may fear, that they are yet in their natural eſtate, that look not whether they be out of it or no.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To exhort us to be more diligent to ſearch out our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, then our worldly, or bodily condition, that we may not be deceived in our ſelves. To move us to ſeek to know our ſpiritual condition truly, let us think of theſe motives.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the ſpiritual eſtate is beſt; we look more after health then wealth, becauſe the body is better then the eſtate; the Soul is much more better then the body.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe it is a more laſting eſtate. Every man prefers a ſee-ſimple, before a leaſe: Heaven laſts longer then any fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimple, infinitely more then it doth beyond a leaſe. Follow then Maſter <hi>Greenhams</hi> counſel, <hi>Of all priſoners, often viſite thine own ſoul.</hi>

                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe an high conceit of our own wiſdome and parts, cannot ſtand with the fear of God, which is required in this verſe: And therefore this it ſet before it, as a removal of a great let of it, which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. It cannot agree with departing from evil, which alſo is required in this verſe, for it makes men ſecure in their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not trying them before hand, whether they be good or evil, becauſe we truſt too much to our own wiſdome, and ſo bring them not to Gods Law to be examined, which is the only true touch-ſtone. Alſo it will make a man ſeek out witty ſhifts and devices, to excuſe his ſins, that ſo he may continue in them. So the Phariſees had their Corban to bring in gain from children by neglect of Parents. <hi>Mark</hi> 7.11.12.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It ſhewes and upholds ignorance in a man. It ſhewes it, becauſe wiſemen diſcern their ignorance, but fooles ſee it not. <hi>Menedemus aiebat multos navigare Athenas, qui primum eſſent ſapientes, deinde fieri ſapientiae amatores, deinde Rhetores, poſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo idiotas.

I ſuppoſe that many might have attained to wiſdome, had they not thought they had attained it already. Who ever durſt teach him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe truth?

                  <p>THE promiſe follows to encourage us to the performance of the duties in the laſt Verſe before. Some conceive it to be meant of ſpirituall health and ſtrength, that under bodily health ſhould be covered, and ſignified a right diſpoſition of the ſoul. Others think proſperity of a mans eſtate to be ſhadowed out by it. I take it plainly for a promiſe of bodily health, for ſuch did God give to his people plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in thoſe younger times of the Law, whereas the Goſpell is more full of promiſes of ſpirituall things. Some joyn this promiſe to Verſe 5, 6, 7. as if God ſhould promiſe thoſe that acknowledge him in all their waies not onely to direct them in right paths, but alſo to give them health and ſtrength to walk wiſely in thoſe paths. But they muſt remember, that this promiſe is made to other good duties. Verſe 7. The ſum is,
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:118645:207"/>humility, fear of God, and avoiding evil will bring bodily health. For the words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It ſhal be,</hi> or <hi>So there ſhal be.</hi> The former directions obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, ſhal bring health, and ſtrength. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Health.</hi> A reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, or preſervation from all ſickneſſes, and infirmities, which the want of thoſe former duties had, or might bring upon thy body. So the word ſignifies, coming from another word that ſignifies to heal, as <hi>health</hi> doth in Engliſh. It ſhal be healthful to thee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To thy navil.</hi> The child is nouriſhed by the navil in the womb, and it knits the upper and lower parts together, and plaiſters laid to it, cure many maladies, eſpecially in little children. By the navil here may be meant all the internall ſoft parts of the body; as the heart, liver, lungs; if theſe be wel, the body is likely to be in health, and ſtrength; elſe it is ſickly and weak.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And marrow.</hi> Heb. <hi>Watering and moistning.</hi> For dry bones without marrow argue weakneſſe, ful ones argue ſtrength.</p>

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>To thy bones.</hi> The bones are the ſupporters of the body, if they fail all falles, as the houſe falls with the pillars. And as the bones grow bigger or longer, ſo doth the body <hi>Albert, l.</hi> 16. <hi>de anima libus,</hi> eſpecially if thoſe bones be ful of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, as in great fat Oxen. <hi>Ariſtot. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de animal.</hi> But when the bones are ful of wind, not of marrow, then they break in pieces. <hi>Avicen.</hi> So ſickneſſe comes. By the bones here may be meant, all the harder and firmer parts of the body. The bones have their names from ſtrength, for indeed they are the ſtrongeſt parts of the body; or by the navil may be meant the external part, the fleſh of the body, which is knit together by the navil, as with a button; and by the bones, the internal parts unſeen, and by health in the navil, the health of the whole body; by marrow in the bones, the ſtrength of it. The ſum then is, that the former vertues mentioned, <hi>verſe</hi> 7. will keep the whole body in perfect health, for when both theſe parts are wel, all is well: For our health depends upon the tender parts, which are vital, and the bones, which are the pillars of the body. So the ſtrength of <hi>Behemoth,</hi> is in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and in his bones, <hi>His force is in the navil of his belly, his bones are as ſtrong pieces of braſs, his bones are like bars of Iron.

                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. A godly life is the beſt Phyſick to preſerve the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in health and ſtrength. Alas, fickneſſe came after his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſting God, and ſending the gold of the Temple to <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hadad,</hi> and impriſoning the Seer, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. <hi>How ſhould one chaſe a thouſand, and two put ten thouſand to flight, except their Rock had ſold them, and the Lord had ſhut them up? Deut.</hi> 32.30. <hi>If thou wilt give ear to the commandements of the Lord, I wil put none of thoſe diſeaſes upon thee, which I have brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Egyptians for I am the Lord that healeth thee. Exod.</hi> 15.26.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe it is the ſafeſt Phyſick to preſcribe: there may be danger in purges, and vomits, they may kill in ſtead of healing. But there is no danger in a godly life, no ſuch man ever miſcaried.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is the eaſieſt to take by them that are godly. <hi>My yoke is eaſy, and my burden is light. Mat.</hi> 11.30. To ſome natures pills go ſo hardly down, they will rather adventure a dying then take them: But to good men, Gods Phyſick is very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It works kindlieſt: ſome phyſick works ſo ſtrongly, it makes men deadly ſick, before it heale them; this pleaſes a good man in the working, he likes the very motions and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of good.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is the ſureſt in operation. Sinne hinders bodily Phyſick, and many a poor man fearing God, recovers of
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:118645:208"/>dangerous Sickneſſes without it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is the beſt Phyſick. Some things are good Antidots, that are not good recoverers: Some things good cordials, that are not good purges, and ſo contrary. This is all, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes, Purges, Cordials, Cure, and all; it ſupplies all to the body to many a poor godly man, that cannot go to the coſt of Phyſick, yet through Gods mercy this heals them.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It makes the moſt laſting cure; it may be bodily Phyſick may work more ſpeedily, but the party may fall into a relaps and die, but this cure laſts longeſt, and in the end cures for good and all. <hi>Job</hi> marvailes at the fat and ſtrength of the wicked. <hi>Job</hi> 21.7.8. <hi>Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power? &amp;c.</hi> So doth <hi>Aſaph. Their eyes stand out with fatneſſe. Pſal.</hi> 73.7. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet he ſaw, <hi>they were ſet on ſlippery places, &amp;c. verſe</hi> 18. There is great odds between a Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, kept wel for labour, and an Oxe fatted for the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and between a body fat and flouriſhing by good meat, and an other ſwelled with tumours by bad. So <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Caleb</hi> died in <hi>Canaan</hi> in a good old age, who obeyed God, when thouſands of Rebels died in the Wilderneſſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. To reprove thoſe that ſpend much money in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and yet overthrow the health and ſtrength of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies by ſinful courſes: they forget the Text, A godly life is <hi>health to the navil, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To perſwade us to uſe this new preſcript for bodily health: Moſt men love to try new medicines; yet this new (perhaps to us) is as old as <hi>Solomon,</hi> and hath found many a <hi>probatum eſt,</hi> both in Scripture, and in after times. Phyſicians need not be angry with me for this preſcript, for God would have their art uſed alſo, but this never to be neglected. There is none of us, but if we were aſſured the Phyſicians potion would heal, would take it, though troubleſome and hard. We are wont to ſay, <hi>There is nothing but I will do it, ſo I may recover health.</hi> Uſe this direction, and thou ſhalt be ſure either to have health here, or happineſſe in heaven.</p>

Many men are timerous, and fear, leſt by this liberality, they ſhould hinder themſelves, and theirs, and not have enough left to maintain them in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable faſhion, and ſo may be much hindred, yea, it may bee want neceſſaries for themſelves, and after much hard labour for poſterity, leave little to their children.

It ſhall bee ſo farre from diminiſhing your eſtate, that God will fill your barnes, and Winepreſſes, ſo that ye ſhall receive far more then ye give away. Fear not what ſhall become of you, your Wives, and Children, God will give you much more to leave them. Thou needſt not ſuſpect, that thy pious liberality, will bring thee to want: it wil rather increaſe thy wealth, and fill thee with all things needfull, and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.

                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. To do, pay, or give what God appoints, is not the way to impoveriſh men, but to enrich them. This in general, if man obey Gods commandements, appears by the bleſsings following, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereof theſe things are part.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If men do what God requires, they loſe not by it, as in not hoarding up corn to make it dear, but ſelling it. <hi>He that witholdeth corn, the people ſhal curſe him, but bleſſing ſhal be on the head of him that ſelleth it. Prov.</hi> 11.26. <hi>Vox populs, vox Dei, the voice of the people is Gods voice</hi> in this kind, and God will curſe them alſo.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In paying dues, and not denying, or putting men to trouble to ſue for them. <hi>Bring ye all the tithes into the store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and I wil rebuke the devourer for your ſakes, and he ſhal not deſtroy the fruits of your ground, neither ſhal your vine caſt her fruit before the time in the field, ſaith the Lord of hoſts.

                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe of Gods command, who doth not uſe to command his to their loſs; or if to temporal loſſe, yet he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quites it in grace, or in glory. <hi>There is no man that hath left houſe, or brethren, or ſiſters, or father, or mother, or wife, or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or lands for my ſake, and the Goſpels, but he ſhal receive an hundred fold now in this time, houſes, and brethren, and ſiſters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with perſecutions, and in the world to come eternal life.

                  <p n="3">3. Experience proves it; we ſee many bleſt outwardly, that are conſcionable in theſe things, and many undone, that doe otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe.</hi> It condemnes thoſe that make no conſcience of hoard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up corn, till it be naught, to the endangering of many mens lives, whoſe blood they muſt needs be guilty of, and though it be the blood of poor men, yet God will require the
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:118645:214"/>blood of poor men, as wel as rich: <hi>When he maketh inquiſition for blood, he remembereth them, he forgetteth not the cry of the humble. Pſal.</hi> 9.12. And ſuch alſo are here condemned, as care for paying no debts without ſuits, nor to part with any thing for the poor: Oh, ſay they, what ſhal our wives and children do, if we be ſo free and conſcientious? <hi>Anſ.</hi> God wil give thee much more: So the Prophet anſwers <hi>Amaziah,</hi> asking, <hi>What ſhall we doe for the hundred Talents? the Lord is able to give thee much more then this.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.9.

                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. To maintain Religion, and Gods worſhip with coſt, doth not impoveriſh men, but inrich them. Witneſs <hi>Davids</hi> coſtly preparations for building the Temple, and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> great charge in building it. The Jews daily coſt in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices encreaſed rather then diminiſhed their cattle. <hi>Since the people began to bring the offerings into the houſe of the Lood, we have had enough to eat, &amp; have left plenty; for the Lord hath bleſsed his people, and that which is left is this great ſtore.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 31.10.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe this coſt to maintain Gods worſhip, is a ſanctified uſury, it is a diſpoſing of money in a lawful way, with expectation of great gain: other uſury is unlawful, and often hurtful, this is lawful and profitable.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Ic is a bleſſed uſury; for as in giving to the poor, <hi>men lend unto the Lord, Prov.</hi> 19.17. ſo in maintaining Gods worſhip, God is the borrower, and he uſeth to pay with increaſe. <hi>Vile eſt, quod datur, ubi tam grande eſt, quod recipitur, That is of little worth which is given, where ſo great a reward is received.

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is a politick uſury: Gods ſervants muſt <hi>be wiſe as ſerpents. Mat.</hi> 10.16. This is the wiſeſt way to beſtow money, and brings in greateſt increaſe, Gods glory muſt be our chiefe end herein, but we may alſo expect Gods bleſſing on our trading in this kind; and Gods people are the more likely to trade with us, and do us good, if we be at coſt for Gods ſervice: which they like as well as we: but this muſt be an inferiour end, leaſt of all regarded.</p>

                     <hi>Uſe.</hi> To exhort us to exerciſe this bleſſed uſury, and to think nothing loſt, that is lent to God. Riches and tithes have the ſame letters in Hebrew, they differ only by a ſtop on the top of

Auguſtin</hi> ſpeaking of thoſe who had their corn ſmitten with blaſting, and mildew, who would not willingly pay their tythes, ſaith, <hi>Reckon now, O covetous wretch: nine parts are withdrawn from thee, becauſe thou wouldſt not give the tenth:</hi> And he addes this reaſon, <hi>Dei enim juſta conſuetudo est, ut ſi es decimam non dederis, tu ad deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam revoceris, novem partibus ſc. detractis.

                  <p>HEre is an anſwer to to an objection, that might be made out of the former verſe.

                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. It taxeth worldly men, who in their afflictions look altogether unto outward means, not eying God the ſtriker, neither do they come to him for remedy. If they be ſick, they blame their diet, or the air, and ſeek onely to the Phyſician for help. If they be wronged, they blame their neighbours, and fly to the Lawyer for help. If they be impoveriſhed, they blame their oppreſſors, and flie to their rich friends for reliefe, but leaſt ſee God in their affliction, upon whom they ſhould moſt of all look. Therefore afflictions rather do them hurt, then good. They make them full of ſpleen againſt the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: they work confidence in men; but do not humble them before God, nor make them amend their waies. The end is like to be miſerable. Afflictions are burdens, and whom they do not bow, they break: look up then to the firſt mover in troubles.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It teacheth good men in all their afflictions to look up to God. This will make us patient. Weak Chriſtians, when they ſee wicked men proſper, and godly men afflicted, are tempted with impatience, as appears at large. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. This Verſe is an Antidote againſt ſuch temptations. Wee muſt receive afflictions from the hand of God with all patience, as from him, that doth all things juſtly. This will make us cheerful in afflictions alſo, if we remember, they are Gods Phyſick to cure the diſeaſes of the ſoul. Every wiſe man takes Phyſick
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:118645:216"/>willingly, as overloooking the bitterneſſe of the pill, and faſtning his eyes on the health enſuing. So ſhould we do in afflictions ſent by God. <hi>O ſervum illum beatum, cujus emenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioni Dominus inſtat, cui dignatur iraſci, quem admonendi diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latione non decipit.

To reprove ſuch as ſleight, not only mens blows, but Gods: Some take no notice of any judgment that lights upon them, as coming from God, but by chance, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it not; they ſay with the Philiſtines, <hi>It was a chance that happened unto us.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.9. Others attribute it to inferiour cauſes, and think them eaſie so be avoided, forgetting, that they have to do with the mighty God; others are ſenceleſſe, and think it a goodly thing to bear out a croſs by head and ſhoulders, as if they were armed againſt all Gods arrowes: of theſe a man may ſay with <hi>Auſtin, Perdidiſtis fructum af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictionis, meſerrimi facti estis &amp; peſſimè permanſiſtis.

Let us not ſleight Gods corrections, as things of no force or uſe, but rather ſtoop at the firſt, and leaſt blow, and fear the very ſhaking of his hand at us; elſe we cauſe God as it were to loſe his labour in nurturing of us. A child is grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe that ſheds no tears, when he is corrected. It argues want of grace in us, if we melt not when God himſelfe corrects us.

                  <p n="2">2. Here is ground for an exhortation to patience, a vertue very needful in this old age of the world, in which one breach followes another, like waves in the Sea; we are all impatient by nature, but grace ſhould make us patient, when for our good we are corrected.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 6. We muſt not be weary of afflictions, though they be great and frequent. <hi>Conſider him that endured ſuch contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of ſinners, lest ye be weary, and faint in your minds; ye have not yet reſisted unto blood, striving against ſin. Heb.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Thou hast born and haſt patience, and for my names-ſake haſt laboured, and haſt not fainted. Rev.</hi> 2.3.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Fainting makes us unfit for all good duties, either of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion or of our callings: we can do nothing truly good, or acceptable to God, without cheerfulneſſe. A weary man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not walk or work with comfort, his ſpirits are ſpent already.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. To reprove ſuch as are weary and faint under af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, ſome bear little ones, or great ones a while, and then give over; ſome utterly deſpair of help, and conclude they are quite undone; others mur mur againſt God; others ſeek freedome by unlawfull meanes, as <hi>Saul</hi> by a Witch. All theſe faint under Gods hand, and ſin againſt him. This is the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extream, we heard before that ſome made light of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and ſleighted them; now we ſee that others deſpair &amp; ſink under them. <hi>Non quia dura, ſed quia molles patimur. Not becauſe the things are hard, but becauſe we that ſuffer are tender. Seneca.</hi> Though it be profitable for us to be arflicted, yet our fleſh is impatient, and deſires nothing but pleaſure and eaſe, and ſo diſcourages us under affliction, as if God intended to deſtroy us: the Devill tells us as much, and we are ready to believe him. But we ſhould <hi>not forget the exhortation, which
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:118645:218"/>ſpeaketh unto us as unto children, My ſon, deſpiſe not thou the chaſtning of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him. Heb.</hi> 12.5.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Reſolve ſtill to bear while God afflicts, remember it is for correction, not for confuſion: And that we are naturally impatient, and had need of patience, which as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> calls it, is <hi>Nervus animae, the ſinew of the ſoul.</hi> Say with <hi>Tertullian, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus mundus mihi pereat, dum modo patientiam lueis faciam: Let me loſe all the world, ſo I may get patience. Lib. de patientia.</hi> If that ſhrinks, all failes; if afflictions, like waves of the ſea, come rouling one in the neck of another, expoſtulate not with God, but pray, and wait for deliverance: be ſuch as the Apoſtle bids you to be, <hi>Rejoycing in hope, patient in tribulation, continuing instant in prayer.

There is in him, that is chast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Lord, ſomething that diſpleaſeth God, to wit, that for which he corrects him, and which he would have amended.</hi> God alſo by correction, keeps his from eternall perdition. Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etions are a bridle, that keeps the horſe from falling, and the rider from breaking his neck: So doth God by them, keep
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:118645:220"/>his children from many ſins, that might bring on them ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy deſtruction. The child of God may ſay to God with <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine in Pſal.</hi> 98. <hi>Et cum blandiris, pater es, &amp; cum caedis, pater es. Blandiris, ne deficiam, caedis, ne peream. Both when thou stro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt, and when thou ſtrskest, thou art afather: Thou ſtrokest, that I ſhould not faint, thou ſtrikest that I ſhould not periſh.</hi> And on the ſame Pſalm. <hi>Illi Deus iraſciter quem peccantem non fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellat. Nam cui verè propitius eſt, non ſolum donat peccata, ne noceant ad futurum ſeculum, ſed etiam caſtigat, ne ſemper pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care delectet. God is angry with him, whom he doth not ſcourge for ſin. For whom he favours indeed, to him he not only forgives ſins, that they may not hurt him in the world to come, but alſo chaſtens him, that he may not delight to be alwaies ſinning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. God corrects his children to do them Good; hereby he exerciſeth and increaſeth many graces in them, as faith, and patience: he alſo fits them for glory hereafter, as ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by pains and perills are fitted for ſpoiles, and trophies; and Merchants paſſing through many ſtormes get riches to live on in their old daies. <hi>For our light affliction which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternall weight of glory.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17.</p>

Pſal.</hi> 119.75. The leſſe reaſon we have to murmur at Gods correcting us, the more certainly we know that corrections are a pledge of his fatherly love toward us, for he corrects the ſon, <hi>quem unicè diligit,</hi> whom he loves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the reſt. <hi>Qui excipitur à numero flagellatorum, excipitur à numero filiorum; He that eſcapes affliction may well ſuſpect his adoption.

He is called an husband I; husbands love their wives, yet be angry with them for their miſcarriage.

                  <p>THough this book of the Proverbs afford not every where a fit coherence of ſeveral verſes, yet where it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently be had, it is not to be neglected. <hi>Solomon</hi> had before perſwaded to patience under Gods afflicting hand; now to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the more to it, he tells us, it is one way to get both wiſdome and happineſſe: as if he had ſaid, faint not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der affliction, for it is not an happineſſe to be free from af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, but to get wiſdome: What though thou ſuffer cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſment, and that be bitter unto thee? if thou get wiſdome by it, thou art happy; yet it muſt not be reſtrained to that way alone, for there are other waies by which wiſdome may be gotten beſides afflictions, as prayer, reading, hearing, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, conference, conſideration of Gods works: which way ſoever a man get true wiſdome, he is happy, and not unhappy, though it be by afflictions, he hath not only made a ſaving, but a gaining bargain. <hi>Solomon</hi> had before given ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular precepts of wiſdome, and now to ſtir up our ſoules to ſeek earneſtly after it, he ſets out the praiſes of it, as being able to bring men to true happineſſe, which they moſt deſire, and no worldly wealth or greatneſſe can beſtow upon them. How bleſſed wiſdome makes a man, may appear, by many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes going before, and many following after. The worth
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:118645:222"/>of wiſdomes gain is largely ſet out, comparatively in the verſes following, it is better then ſilver. <hi>Object.</hi> Thereare more pretious things then ſilver in the world. <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then fine gold. <hi>Object.</hi> Yet Jewels and pearls may be better then that. <hi>Anſ.</hi> She is more pretious then Rubies. <hi>Object.</hi> There may be better things then Rubies, though we know them not. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Deſire what thou canſt, thou canſt deſire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo good as wiſdome. Then he ſets out the praiſe of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſimply without compariſon, it brings long life. <hi>Object.</hi> what is a long poor life worth? <hi>Anſ.</hi> She brings riches withall, <hi>Obj.</hi> Many a rich man is ſordid and deſpiſed. <hi>Anſ.</hi> She brings honour alſo. <hi>Object.</hi> Many have all theſe, yet live ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by reaſon of ſickneſſe and pain. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Her waies are pleaſant. <hi>Object.</hi> war ſpoiles all comfort. <hi>Anſ.</hi> All her paths are peace. <hi>Object.</hi> yet death will take away all theſe. <hi>Anſ.</hi> She is a tree of life. Therefore I conclude as I began, with the happineſſe of the man that finds wiſdome: only I add this qualification, if he retain her, when he hath found her. For the words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Happy.</hi> Or <hi>O the happineſs of the man, &amp;c.</hi> He begins his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of wiſdome with an exclamation, &amp; admiration of the good it brings to men, which Gods people wonder at, though others be blind &amp; Iee it not: he had ſpoken great things of the benefits of wiſdome before, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. as bringing along com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and peaceable life; but here he ſpeake in higher lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, it will bring happineſſe, which is an affluence, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confluence of all good things, and that for eternity. A man that hath ſome good things may want other to content him. If a man had all things that are good for him, but for a time, fear of loſſe will afflict him, while he hath them, and his grief will be the greater when they are loſt, by reaſon of his former experience of the ſweetneſſe of them. A wiſe man is happy here, <hi>ſpe, in hope,</hi> he ſhall be happy hereafter, <hi>re, in deed.</hi> He doth not ſay, <hi>bleſſed is the wiſe man,</hi> but ſpeaks by a circumlocution, <hi>bleſſed is the man that findeth wiſdome, and the man that getteth understanding.</hi> So he compares the wiſe man to a man not left rich by his parents, but grown rich by Gods bleſſing on his labours. Men count them happy, that are grown rich by their own induſtry; God counts them happy that labour for wiſdome and do obtain it.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe it loſeth nothing by communicating to others. The more mony we give, the leſſe we have: but it is not ſo in communicating wiſdom.

                  <p>LEſt any man ſhould think, that wiſdom were needy and beggarly her ſelf, and could not beſtow upon her fellows the riches promiſed, ſhe ſhews now, that ſhe knows, what humane infirmity moſt needs, and what men moſt deſire, and hath in a readineſſe to beſtow on them. Thou feareſt death, poverty, diſhonour. Wiſdome hath long life, riches, honour to beſtow upon thee, if thou entertain her. Wiſdom, or the Lord Ieſus Chriſt is here ſet out unto us like ſome ſtately Queen, ſitting on a Throne with both hands full of good things to reward her faithfull ſervants.

                     <hi>Length of daies.</hi> A long life, ſee on Verſe 2. This is the firſt thing promiſed, becauſe it is the principall; and riches and honour are but acceſſaries, and can afford no comfort, if life be taken away, and but little, if life be ſhort. And therefore alſo it is ſaid to be in the right hand, as the principall gift ſhe hath to beſtow. Men moſt of all deſire long life, and riches and honour in the ſecond place; they could be content to live, though poorly, though in pain, rather then to die; they deſire long life more then riches, and fear death more then poverty. There is no merchandiſe in the world, how good ſoever, nor pearles, how pretious ſoever they be, that can aſſure us of long life. But the greateſt traders are moſt affraid to die, as having more to loſe then other men; and their death is more deſired then other mens: yea, many lie in wait to kill them, for their riches: But wiſdome will bring long life with it.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Gods bleſſing follows it. For when he gives one bleſſing, he gives another. If hee give wiſdom, hee can afford riches.</p>

                     <hi>Uſe.</hi> To blame thoſe, that would be rich, but care not for being wiſe. Wiſdom can make men rich; but riches cannot make men wiſe. It is often obſerved, that the elder brotheri carry away the land, and the younger the wit. So God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides his gifts, when he pleaſe.

                  <p>HEre is another motive to get wiſdom: wouldſt thou goe in pleaſant waies, and live in peace, and quietneſſe? All wiſdoms waies are ſuch. The man who gets wiſdom, gets true happineſſe, and delight. When Merchants go by Sea, or paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers by land, they are glad, when they find fair way, and a quiet paſſage. They deſire not to be ſtaid, nor hindred in their journey, but to go at eaſe without any diſturbance, which yet ſometime they miſſe. But ſuch as walk wiſely, find waies of pleaſure, and peace. Theſe words are fitly knit to the former, for long life, and riches, and honour are not ſufficient to make a man happy. He may meet with many occaſions of ſorrow, and of War, and trouble, which may make his life very uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable. Here therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> addes to the former bleſſings, pleaſure, and peace, to ſhew, that nothing is wanting to a wiſe man. Hee had commended wiſdom before <hi>ex parte termini,</hi> from happineſſe in the end: now he commends it <hi>ex parte medii,</hi> from the comfort of the way. The allective power of wiſdom is ſet out in this verſe, the conſervative in the next.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. They have nothing truly difficult in them, though they may ſeem to men to have. Smooth waies have nothing in them to make men ſtumble, yet men may ſlip by careleſneſſe in the ſmootheſt way. Here is no offering up of children in Gods waies, which the heathen did to falſe Gods: yea, it is now ſmoother then the Jews way was in the old Teſtament; no painfull Circumciſion, nor extream coſtly Sacrifices, no <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Rams, nor ten thouſand rivers of Oile.

The heathen
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:118645:234"/>found ſome comfort in morall actions, Chriſtians may find more in ſpirituall imployments. <hi>In keeping of them there is great reward. Pſal.</hi> 19.11.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As in ſpirituall, ſo in temporall things, wiſe men find much comfort in their waies, when fooles bring ſorrow upon themſelves. Likewiſe in the end, as well as in the way, wiſe men find comfort; yea, more in the end then in the way: the hope of heaven makes the way comfortable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it ſhould be tedious in it ſelfe, and meet with many rubs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe.</hi> This ſhould encourage us, not only to ſeek to know wiſdomes waies, but alſo to walk cheerfully in them, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight of all diſcouragements.</p>
                  <p>If any object, it is difficult to get the knowledge of thoſe waies, and much more difficult to walk in them.</p>
                  <p>The anſwer is, there is pleaſure in them as well as profit, and that will make them eaſie and delightfull. <hi>Omne tulit pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum, quimiſcit utile dulci. Joyn profit and pleaſure together, and men will never talk of difficulty.</hi> Now wiſdom makes a marriage of profit with pleaſure; her waies may ſeem difficult at firſt, by reaſon of the corruption of the fleſh, but when the firſt brunt is over, they prove eaſie and pleaſant, whereas the waies of folly are pleaſant at firſt, and bitter at laſt. Let us therefore admire at wiſdomes waies, get the knowledge of them, practiſe them, and rejoyce in them.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. Peace with our neighbours. For it teacheth us to give every one their own. And what ground have they then to quarrell with us? yea, if they do us hurt, it teacheth us to doe them good. And this is the way to quench all fire of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. By plain places or grounds of religion, to interpret the reſt, that are built thereupon, as we do in Logick and other Arts.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. To teach us to uſe this help in difficult places, and not to allow of any ſenſe of any place of Scripture, not agreeing with other Scriptures. So about Baptiſme, <hi>Go teach all nations.</hi> The originall is, <hi>Make Diſciples of all nations, Mat.</hi> 28.19. And that by <hi>Baptizing,</hi> as followes in the words,

So about the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.50. is pleaded againſt it, yet all the Chapter before and after pleads for it. The Apoſtle ſaith there, <hi>Fleſh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdome of God:</hi> His meaning is, mortall, and corruptible fleſh and blood cannot come to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, till it be changed: ſo he expounds himſelfe in the end of that Verſe, and the Verſe following, <hi>Neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.</hi> And, <hi>We ſhall all be changed.</hi> Thus <hi>John</hi> 14.28. is brought to diſprove Chriſts divine Nature Chriſt ſaith, <hi>My father is greater then I:</hi> This muſt be underſtood of his human nature, for in regard of his divine, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He thought it no robbery to be equall with God. Phil.</hi> 2.6. The Jews underſtood this, that <hi>He made himſelfe equall with God. John</hi> 5.18. which had been blaſphemy indeed, had not he been true God. So for excluding bread out of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.26. <hi>This is my body,</hi> is cited by the Papiſts; but it muſt be underſtood figuratively, not literally: The meaning is, this is the ſign of my body; for <hi>Paul</hi> calls it <hi>bread,</hi> when it is <hi>eaten,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. God cannot contradict himſelfe.</p>

The ſoul muſt be infuſed into the body, before it can work on the body to make the tongue to ſpeak, the foot to goe, the hand to work. A man muſt be married to a woman before hee can take care for her, as for a wife. So muſt wiſdom be joyned to the heart, before it can worke on heart, ſoule, or body.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe it is ſo in all other gifts of God. A man cannot be liberal, to whom God gives no riches, nor fight ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to whom God gives no ſtrength, nor doe any good with wiſdom, or get any good by it, to whom God gives it not.</p>

                  <p>IN this Verſe and the next, <hi>Solomon</hi> flies high, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends wiſdom from working by it, and from the things which he wrought. As if he had ſaid, what need I ſay more in commendation of wiſdom? The whole world, which yee ſee, was made by it. Here he ſhews, how it comes to paſſe that wiſdom makes men happy. It was that, whereby God made the World, and therefore he can make men happy by it. Great things were attributed to wiſdom before, but greater here. As if <hi>Solomon</hi> had ſaid, O young man, thou haſt heard many things in commendation of wiſdom, now hear more, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that thou maiſt bee the more inflamed with the love of it. It is not a wiſdom found out by men, as the Philoſophers imagined, who thought all wiſdom depended upon their precepts, and might be gotten by humane induſtry. The wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, whereof I ſpeak, is far antienter then the world, for the very foundations of the world were laid by it. Think not then this wiſdom a thing feigned in the braines of men, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing with them, and therefore to be deſpiſed, but look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, as upon Jeſus Chriſt the eternall ſon of God and Creatour of the World together with God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Solomon</hi> doth not now ſet out wiſdome by benefits to us, as before, but by the majeſty thereof, and the greatneſſe of the workes, that God doth by it. Among which the making of Heaven, and Earth, and all things therein is exceeding commendable: But it may be objected: <hi>Solomon</hi> had before commended wiſdom, as it is in men: why doth hee now ſore ſo high from wiſdom in men to wiſdom in God, there being ſo vaſt a difference? The wiſeſt man on Earth is but a fool to God, and muſt never expect by his wiſdom to do ſuch great things, as God hath done.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer. 1. Becauſe <hi>Solomons</hi> intention was to commend wiſdom in generall, bee it in the Creator, or in the Creature.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe wiſdome in man hath ſome reſemblance of that wiſdom, that is in God, though it be farre ſhort of it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe it is a little ſtream coming from that infinite
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:118645:239"/>fountain of wiſdome that is in God, yet not materially, for God hath never the leſſe, but effectively, as wrought in us by it. When a man hath commended the ſtream, and ſhewed the vertues of it, it addes to the credit of it to ſhew the fountain, whence it comes, and the admirable effects thereof: So it is a commendation to mans exquiſit wiſdom, to ſhew, that it comes from the infinite wiſdom of God, by which heaven and earth were made.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To prove it may well guide a man in all his affairs in the world, and make him happy (as Verſe 18.) ſeeing it comes from that wiſdom by which God made all things, the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of ſolid things, as heaven, and earth, are ſet down in this verſe, and of liquid things, as waters, and rain, Verſe 20.</p>
                  <p>For the words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Lord.</hi> See on <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.7.</p>

                     <hi>By wiſdome.</hi> See on <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.7. Wiſdome may be underſtood as of an attribute of God, for his infinite wiſdome was uſed in the creation of the world: But it is better to underſtand it of Jeſus Chriſt, the wiſdom of the father, <hi>By whom all things were made, &amp; without whom, was not any thing made, that was made. Joh.</hi> 1.3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hath founded.</hi> Hath laid the foundations of the earth ſo ſure, that though it hang in the midſt of heaven, yet it ſubſiſts of it ſelfe, remains unmovable, and upholds the reſt of the world. It is like the rock upholding the houſe. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.24, 25. The earth is the loweſt of all the elements, the center of the reſt, upholding them all without any thing under it, to uphold it. Thus men and beaſts have room, where they may live and breath: though it have no foundation, yet it ſtands as faſt, as if it had a ſtrong foundation, anſwerable to the greatneſſe of it. The words may admit a double ſenſe, either that God did at firſt by his infinite wiſdome, ſo juſtly poiſe the earth, that it ſhould be upheld by its own equall weight, and have no inclination to move upward, downward, or aſide; or elſe, that Gods power immediately ſtill without any thing wrought in the earth at firſt, upholds it, as a ſure foundation, and makes it a laſting foundation to uphold all the viſible world. God by his infinite wiſdome ſo placed the earth as a foundation, that ſhould never remove out of his place, leſt the foundation failing, the reſt of the building ſhould fall and periſh.</p>

For the word, ſee on <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.22.</p>

                     <hi>Reaſon.</hi> 1. In the regard of the thing it ſelf.

                  <p n="2">2. In regard of the time. Hee ſendeth it, when the Earth moſt needs it. Former rain to bring forth the corn out of the Earth, and latter rain to bring forth the latter crop, hay, or graſſe. An hermit being asked why his little ground thrived more then anothers greater, who prayed for rain, and faire weather, when he thought it needfull, anſwered, becauſe I pray to God, who is wiſer then I, to ſend ſuch weather, as he pleaſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In regard of the manner. That it ſhould drop down ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly like water out of a ſtill.

                     <hi>Uſe.</hi> Pray to God for rain when ye need it and praiſe him, when ye have it in convenient time.

                     <hi>SOlomon</hi> having before mentioned the great effects of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, now renews his exhortation, to remember all her precepts. Hee would not have men to have a low opinion of wiſdom, whereof he had given ſo large commendations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and gives more afterwards in this Chapter, propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more benefits, that will come hereby. Wiſdom is a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ineſtimable, wonderfull, profitable, and full of pleaſure, as we have heard, and ſtill may hear out of this book, when we ſee that <hi>Solomon</hi> is not content with the former praiſes, whereby he hath declared unto us the profit, and pleaſure, that they have, which are poſſeſſed with wiſdom, but doth admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us in the text carefully to keep it.</p>
                  <p>For the words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My Son.</hi> See on <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.1.8.</p>

Do not think of them onely at leiſure times, but meditate of them continually. Keep wiſdom once gotten as charily, as men do things, which they affect ſo much, that they will never let them go out of their fight, but watch them perpetually, as God doth <hi>Zion, Behold I have graven thee upon
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:118645:246"/>the Palmes of my hands, thy walls are continually before me. Iſa.</hi> 49.16.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Wiſdome once gotten, muſt never be forgotten. This is one of the laſt leſſons of the old Teſtament, <hi>Remember the Law of Moſes my ſervant, &amp;c. Hoſ.</hi> 4.4. It is required in the new, <hi>Remember how thou haſt received, and heard, and hold faſt. Rev.</hi> 3.3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe of the excellency of wiſdome ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we do not eaſily forget things excellent, either for beauty or uſe: Who forgets the virgin he is in love withall? or the medicine that heals him?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the profit of them: we eaſily forget things that bring no gain, but who forgets his gold, or trade, though he be old? <hi>Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth. Acts</hi> 19.25.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe of the loſſe, that followes on the loſſe of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which is very great, the loſſe of all thoſe good things, which wiſdom would procure for us, temporall, ſpirituall, or eternall; beſides, the loſſe of memory it ſelfe, that when it hath unburdened it ſelfe of that which is good, will eaſily forget meaner things.</p>
                  <pb n="496" facs="tcp:118645:247"/>
                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe of the danger that followes this forgetfulneſſe, it will bring all thoſe evills in the world, which wiſdome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained might prevent. He that forgets his medicine, muſt bear his pain. It will alſo bring eternall miſery in another world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. To reprove ſuch as have loſt more knowledge, then they have left, whoſe bloſſomes were fair, but are fallen off: they are like many witty tradſmen, that ſpend money as faſt as they get it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To exhort us to remember the good things we have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Motives</hi> 1. Wiſdomes precepts coſt us much pain to get, and ſhould not then eaſily be loſt; we ſtrove againſt natures ſtreams to get it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We look for much good by it, which will be loſt with it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Means.</hi> 1. Think often of wiſe inſtructions, eſpecially the principall. So Archers think often of the mark, Pilots of the guiding ſtarre, travallers of the marks of the way. The Jews wore Phylacteries to keep Gods commandements in their memories, <hi>Numh.</hi> 15.38.39. The way is hard to hit, and dangerous to miſſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Set your affections upon them, elſe other things will take you off from thinking of them. Children eaſily forget what they learn, play takes them off. Men are ſerious in what they like. As the ſtone on the ſtill waters makes circles one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another, and ſo the former periſh, ſo doth buſineſſe put out wiſdoms precepts.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Speak often of wiſe things. A Maſter learns by teaching ſcholars.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Practiſe them. No man forgets his trade, while he is able to work in it. To conclude this point, think how carefull worldly parents are to call upon their children to keep tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory riches; and take notice how gently, and often <hi>Solomon</hi> calls upon us in this book, not to forget wiſdomes precepts, leſt we loſe ſpirituall profit here, and eternall glory hereafter offered to us, and ſo periſh eternally, and then forget wiſdome precepts if thou canſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. Wiſdoms precepts muſt be dear to us. As dear as <hi>ſilver,</hi> and as pretious as <hi>hid treaſures. Chap.</hi> 2.4. Dearer then <hi>ſilver, gold, rubies. Chap.</hi> 8.10, 11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe they have been ſo alwaies to Gods people,
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:118645:247"/>as the delight of their eyes, without which they could not be ſatiated, nor ſatisfied. So they were to <hi>David, O how I love thy Law! it is my meditation all the day. Pſal.</hi> 119.97. So to <hi>Paul, I count all things but loſſe for the excellency of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord. Phil.</hi> 3.8.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe they are ſo to them in all conditions: the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of proſperity cannot take off their affection from them, nor the croſſes of adverſity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe.</hi> To reprove thoſe who ſet light by wiſdoms precepts: many books will down with them, and human hiſtories, but Gods word is ſleighted by them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. Wiſdoms precepts muſt be carefully laid up by us. So did <hi>David, Thy word have I hid in mine heart, Pſal.</hi> 119.11. So did the Virgin <hi>Mary, His Mother kept all theſe ſayings in her heart, Luke</hi> 2.51.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. For direction in time of proſperity, for then our waies have much danger in them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For conſolation in time of adverſity, of which we have much need.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe.</hi> Let us do with wiſdoms precepts, as worldly men do with needfull inſtruments, not throw them about the houſe, but lock them up, that they may be ready in time of need. Keep by meditation what is got by ſtudy.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe there is no life in the Soul, till knowledge come into it. There was no living creature in the world, till light was made. God clears the underſtanding before he rectifie the will, and affections; he keeps the ſame method in the little world, that he did in the great world. We are no better by nature then the Epheſians, of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks in the place newly cited. As the body is dead without the ſoul, ſo the Soul is dead without wiſdome, which is the ſoul of the ſoul: Though the Soul be the life of the body, yet it ſelfe is dead, if without knowledge, and ſuch a man dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers not from a beaſt, unleſſe it be in being ſubject to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall miſerie. That a man then may live ſpiritually, and not ſenſually like a beaſt, it is the gift of heavenly wiſdom; and thy ſoul hath life with God if thou keep wiſdomes precepts, although thy fleſh be preſſed down under the diſcipline of correction, or of the fear of death it ſelfe.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe as the fooliſh ſoul hath no life, being without juſtification, ſo it can have no health nor ſtrength, being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſanctification. Health is a ſecond life, without which, the firſt is a burden: Better not to live, then to live in pain, or weakneſſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It hath no ſpirituall breath, and without breath, no life; It cannot breath out prayers nor praiſes to God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 It hath no ſpirituall motion, and all living things move in one way or another; dead things do not. No motion to any ſpirituall duty, till wiſdome take poſſeſſion of the ſoul.</p>

                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Pitty thoſe thouſands of poor ſouls, that walk in the world, yet are ſpiritually dead. Ignorant men think dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies walk, but we know dead ſouls walk. Many are like ſc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchers, that have only the names of living men written on them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. See if thy ſoul be not one of theſe dead ſouls. If thou have not true wiſdome, <hi>thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead. Rev.</hi> 3.1. It is not thy great birth, wealth, nor ſtrength, that can make thee alive, it muſt be wiſdome.</p>

                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. From the confeſſion of the heathen. <hi>Is proprie, vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que homo eſt, cujus omnis in anima rationali ſubstantia existit. Qua propter quicquid extra hunc hominem ſit, id ad ſe minimè per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinet. Plato in Alcibiade. He is properly and truly a man, all whoſe ſubſtance is in the reaſonable ſoule; wherefore whatſoever is out of this man, that belongs not to him,</hi> in his own account.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the contrary. Folly is the death of the ſoul; ſin that kills it, is commonly called folly in Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. From the beginning of life. Wiſdom is, as it were, the ſeed of ſpirituall life.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. From the Progreſſe; it maintaines the life of the ſoul, as meat doth the life of the body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Take pains to get true and heavenly wiſdome. What pains doth the Husbandman take, to get his ſeed into the ground? he plows, and ſows. What pains do poor men take for food? they work hard early and late, and all, or almoſt all for the belly. So do thou for wiſdome: And as the merchant runs through pain and perill for wealth, ſo do thou for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</p>
                  <pb n="500" facs="tcp:118645:249"/>
                  <p n="2">2. Spare for no coſt to get it. The husbandman, Tradſeman, Merchant, drive on their trades with great coſt; wiſdoms trade is better. It concerns eternity. Spare then no coſt to get, and keep it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Doct.</hi> Wiſdom is a great grace to any man. <hi>The wiſe ſhall inherit glory.</hi> ver. 35. <hi>of this</hi> Chap. <hi>They ſhall be an orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of grace unto thy head, and chaines about thy neck.</hi> Chap. 1.9.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon.</hi> 1. Becauſe it is a ſign of worth and dignity in a man. Men nobly born, or in great place wear gold chains, and jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells. Wiſe men are Gods children of the higheſt birth, and more honoured with ſpirituall graces, and holy behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, then any other can be with gold and ſilver, though never ſo rich &amp; coſtly. They need not fear coming into Gods preſence, nor diſgrace from men, for good men will reverence them, though they be never ſo mean, and none will contemn them, but wicked men, which are themſelves the moſt contemptible of all the creatures.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe it doth adorn men as gold-chains do. Such as are beautifull themſelves, are more beautifull in coſtly dreſſings.

This ſhews the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers obſervation to be falſe, that happy men differ not from miſerable men half their time, to wit, when they are aſleep. For a godly wiſe man is happy, when he is aſleep: a fooliſh ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is then miſerable: wicked men alwaies fear that other men are laying ſnares for them for the evills they have done them. They know that enemies then are moſt ready to lay ſnares for them, and have moſt hope to prevail againſt them, when they are aſleep. Alſo their covetous mind runs upon their treaſure, being in continuall fear of loſing their riches. Hence comes terrible affrighting fancies into their minds, and fearful dreams by reaſon of their ill conſcience, and wickedneſſe, whereas godly wiſe men ſleep quietly, being kept by wiſdome which they have embraced. <hi>Pertranſcuntibus autem à vigilia, ſcilicet, ad ſomnum, meliora ſunt phantaſmata virtuoſorum, quàm quorumcunque.</hi> Ariſtor.

Moſt interpreters underſtand it of giving to the poor, and trouble themſelves much to know, how the poor are owners of other mens goods. An hard phraſe, and not to be found in Scripture in this ſenſe, which uſually calls it giving freely, and Almes, and poor men are taught to ask for mercy, not to demand it as due. And they who make them owners of other mens goods open a great gap to them to take it by foul means, if they cannot have it by intreaty, and to ſay, <hi>May I not take mine own goods, where I find them? what ſhould hinder?</hi> Some ſay, poor men have an intereſt in other mens goods, becauſe of their goods, becauſe of their wants; others, that they have it by nature, being men as we are; others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God bids us relieve them. But theſe titles will hardly make them to be maſters of what is not theirs. The interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters run this way, becauſe the next Verſe mentions giving to the poor. But as this interpretation anſwers not well to the Hebrew words, ſo it confounds two duties, paying debts in this verſe, and giving to the poor in the next. Neither will it ſerve to ſay, This Verſe requires giving, and the next doing it ſpeedily, for the word, of <hi>not withholding</hi> in this Verſe requires ſpeedy payment: eſpecially joyned to the words following, <hi>when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.</hi> I conclude therfore, that paying of debts to creditors, or labourers is here meant, who ought to have, what others injuriouſly keep from them. And this is a work of juſtice, not of mercy. For the word ſee on <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.17. on the word <hi>Bird.</hi> Heb. <hi>Master of a wing.</hi>

The excuſes of covetous men will prove the point; one, though rich, objects the weakneſſe of his eſtate, ſuch an one worth much more then I, gives little or nothing; as if the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers greater neglect could excuſe his leſſer. Another ſaith, the poor are idle, and he will not give to maintain them in their idleneſſe; He forgets, that it is better to give to two that
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:118645:260"/>need not, then to deny to one that needs. Another ſaith the times are naught, trading is dead, and he may live to want himſelfe: as if he durſt not truſt God for the future, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver failed him in all his life.

                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe there are many vices in evill men, and many vertues wrought by God in good men; yet one is predominant: we ſay, one man is cholerick, though he have other humors, becauſe that prevailes: So among wicked, ſome are froward to men, others are impious towards God, others ſcorners of piety, others fooliſh in their waies: Among good men, ſome are more righteous and juſt, ſome more lowly or wiſe then others, and ſome of theſe names may fit one good man, and ſome another.</p>

                  <p>HEre is the laſt motive to ſtir us up to get wiſdome, and forſake the waies of wickedneſſe, becauſe the one brings glory, the other ſhame; and it is fitly knit to the former: for the humble, who are the only wiſe ones, go from grace to glory: and the proud ſcorner, who is the greateſt fool, ſhall fall from honour to ſhame. Seeing humble men are counted ſimple, and proud men wiſe, and ſin prefers many, and grace makes many contemned in the world, he therefore raiſes up the dejected heart of the one, and caſts down the proud ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the other, by pronouncing the lowly wiſe, and the ſcorners fooles, and by promiſing honour to the one, like to men in a riſing condition, and threatning diſgrace to the other, as to men going down the wind. Glory followes fitly after grace, and ſhame after ſcorning; for men honour thoſe they favour, and put them to ſhame whom they ſcorn.</p>

I may reverence a man for any cauſe; yea, though it be but out of fear: but if I reverence a man for his vertue, then I give him honour, though it be in ſecret, and before a few: But when I commend him, or preferre him for vertue openly before many, then I give him glory, which is a cleer acknowledgment with praiſe: He addes, Wiſdome makes a man honorable before a multitude, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
